authority extends so far that he can even forbid his
relations to use opium; he trades with the drug, but
considers that the use of it is fatal.


Deo Van Tri is therefore a dreaded and powerful
feudal chief, who has rendered and will again render
us great services. AVhen Colonel Pennequin wished to
open a campaign against Doc Ngu he summoned Deo
Van Tri to come to him at Hong-Hoa and act as his
adviser. His struggles with and against the pirates
have made him thoroughly acquainted with them.
"My family has fought with them for a long time,"
he said to me. " I have seen them and know
them well. You may repulse them, but you will not
crush them, either in the Delta or on the frontier. To
get rid of them and completely subdue them you
must strike at Pekin ! "


The territory over which he rules extends far to
the north of Laichau, and several clays' march on the  
  
  
  right bank of the Black River. AVe seem to haveforgotten this when we provisionally divided the country
with China, but this omission can be easily remedied
by the Commission of Delimitation; we hope that
itwill come to some understanding with the Chinese
authorities to avoid injuring, by diminishing or
dividing his territories, this great chief, who is one of
our most useful partisans in the north-west of Tonkin.
Even beyond the districts which he governs directly,
his influence makes itself felt as far as the Yunnan to
the north, and the middle of the Sibsompannas to the
west. His assistance was extremely useful to the
Pavie Mission, which he personally accompanied into
the centre of those provinces. The Chinese have
realized his strength; they did not name him Im mou

with a red cloth, some cocks' feathers and some
squirrels' tails; there are a few tombs, which consist
of mounds of upturned earth surmounted by a pole
which carries a rag; at one extremity three flat
stones form a niche, in one of them I see a pair of
Chinese slippers.


Another few hours' march through the same rising
ground, where the road makes continual zigzags as it
winds amongst calcareous blocks, which seem thrown
down by accident, and we reach the banks of the
Nam-Ma. This left affluent of the Song-Bo is from
thirty to forty yards wide, and flows noiselessly in a
stream of very clear water over a bed of shingles; it
can be forded anywhere. The people fish in it
with rods; they stand at the head of a current and
cast their lines backwards and forwards with a
movement that reminds me of the trout fishers at home.


AVe follow the river sometimes on one side and
sometimes on the other till wre come to the village of
Nam-Ma, where we halt. Sadly fallen from its former
wealth, this commercial centre, once an important
market town of brick houses, now contains only one
street, a dozen Chinese huts, and a few Muong
buildings. The black and yellow flags have passed through
here driven back by the French, and their departure
has ruined the prosperity of the little town.


Caravans from China only come here three or four
times a year, passing through the Yao villages in the
neighbourhood. The latter possess some forty mules,
and trade during three or four months when there is
not too much water in the torrents. Opium is worth
two piastres and a half the ten tens here; a picul of
cotton is exchanged for forty-six tens of opium; salt

from the British Government " to make an inquiry on
the situation and the trade routes " of this little
known region, and " on the probable results which
the commercial clauses of the treaty recently concluded
between France and China would have on English
Trade with the interior markets of Kouang-Si and
Yunnam."


And we, who are most interested, have we done for
ourselves what our rivals undertook for themselves to
guard against competition ? Have we sent out agents in
every direction throughout the regions bordering upon
Tonkin ? Have we organized commercial missions to
go to Yunnan-Sen and the Yangtze and to consult
o o
the big Chinese merchants, coming to an
understanding with them, and gathering definite
information ? Nothing of the sort. It is to the reports of
the English consul that the Devrez, the Pichons, the
Wehrungs and so many others who are anxious to
let France see what a commercial future we may hope
for in China, have to refer; for one really must have
other backing than vague notions when one seeks to
arouse the interest of timid capitalists. It is only
with proofs in hand that one can hope to render
popular, by showing certain good results, a conquest
still so little known and understood.


It is impossible to come upon the few French
documents which exist; they are scattered here and there,
buried in archives, forgotten or lost. Questions to
the Minister of Marine, inquiries and researches at
the Chamber of Commerce are of little use.

bridegroom's house.


"He says to the young bride :' ' If you wash the
plates, you must break them in several pieces; if you
make sauce, take the large spoon and break the
saucepans. '


"A great number of clucks are ravaging the
ricefields, and the father and mother send their daughter
to drive away the birds. She is there from morning
till night, but they do not move; overwhelmed with
fatigue, the woman finds herself unable to drive the
ducks away, so she returns to the house, where every
one has finished supper but herself. She goes to the
kitchen to find something to eat, but only a head and
tail are left of the fish, and one wing and a claw of
the chicken.


\"The husband perceives that his wife does not
behave herself well; she combs everything the
wrongway of the hair, going from the tail to the head, and
she breaks all the crockery. He takes her and offers
to sell her to her former lover for a packet of banana

is his wife from that time."  
  
  
  THE ADVENTURE OF KHOUNE LOU AND OF NANG HOU.


\"Once upon a time there were two young girls,
two sisters. They were named Kham Som, the elder,
who lived at Muong Peang, and Nang Ngin Lieang,
who lived quite near at Muong Sai.


\"It was summer and the heat was excessive, so
they both decided to go and bathe in the river. Then

Below the shaft, a quay is being constructed, where
there will be from thirteen to sixteen feet of water at
low tide. The two sides ofthe ravine are connected by
a bridge upon piles nearly 100 feet long, and another
bridge of a similar kind will enable the railway from
Kaidai to reach this point. This second working is
done in covered galleries, and safety-lamps are
employed on account of the fire-damp.


In the near future, a railway eight miles long, with
a gauge of 40 inches in lieu of the present line of
24 inches, will connect these workings with a place
on the coast of Kebao, where a port can be opened in
deep water. Moreover, apart from the income of the
mines, the necessities of revictualling for the marine
force and the strategical position of this port cannot
fail to make it a very important one.


The Pirate Islands and the Green Island, at the
entrance of the bay, can easily be fortified, and if
the French administration ever decides to construct
practical railways or to guarantee a fixed interest to
companies willing to do so, one of the first will, no
doubt, be that connecting Tien-Yen, at the extremity
of the gulf, to Haiphong or Hanoi, in which case the
importance of the new port would be increased
tenfold. M. Portal proposes to turn the land to a profit
by cultivation as well. Several of the valleys are
very fertile, and they will supply rice for the coolies,
and hemp for rope-making, while castor oil will
probably supersede pitch and tar in the manufacture
of coal-bricks, experiments having already been made
in regard to this. The fine forests in the island

AVe held all the trumps. AVe still hold them, and
we may win the game with the products of our
national industry in the great markets of China.  
  
  
  Do not let us lose them.


Merchants, remember that while French imports
into Tonkin amount to only £480,000 for 12,000,000
inhabitants, the direct imports of England into
Burmah were, even in 1884, £2,840,000 for only
4,434,000 inhabitants; and that from 1891-92 the
foreign trade of Burmah was 250,000,000 rupees.


Remember that Tonkin is richer, three times more
populous, and better situated than Burmah.


Remember that Tonkin produces cotton, contains
some millions of tons of coal, and is linked to China
by the shortest and the best route.

the stages of creation. A7egetable life exists in a
simple form, but animal life has not yet appeared.
I have spent weeks on the steppes when only an
occasional animal was to lie seen. The lines which
bounded them, their extent, their colour, conduced
to reverie. But I have never known anything so
dreary as this foliage, which is alw-ays the same, and
which seems to reject every solicitation of a
fecundating sun.


AVe are in the dry season and it is only at night
that we find a small rivulet, almost as silent as the
nature which surrounds it. And yet, after the
sadness of the day, it is for us a deliverance. The
elephants are drawn up in line and unloaded. The
shelter for the night is set up, and fires lighted.
The animals are taken to drink, and we are not
sorry to pass an hour or two in cheerful conversation.


In the solitude of these forests the sliohtest
incident arouses our curiosity or attracts our
attention. Now it is an elephant who shies off the
road, and utters a hoarse cry; now it is a box
which gets upset and has to be put right; now it is
the meeting with a caravan of oxen. The animals are
small with fine heads and shapely legs. They are
loaded with long baskets which hang on either side
of a hairy saddle and are covered with bamboo. En
route they wear a sort of muzzle, like the horses in the
Yunnam caravans, to prevent them from stopping to
eat. Their drivers are, for the most part, inhabitants
of a village, which is shifting itself for the time being
for rice-growing. They have small tents with canvas
or straw flaps.  
  
  
  In dearth of animals or flowers we interest
<!-- Leaf 314, Page: 298 -->
ouryears, are still so generally true, but I will content
myself with the few lines which follow, taken from
the very last page of his book :—


"Unfortunately, we have hitherto subordinated our
policy to that of England, and our diplomatists,
accustomed to making light of interests so far away,
have sacrificed them to the requirements of the cordial
understanding between the two countries. But these
sacrifices have not been repaid, for the more we
have effaced our policy in favour of that approved by
our neighbours, the less have they taken us into
account. In future, we ought to follow a precisely
opposite line of conduct."


To revert to Luang Prabang, we have a Vice-Consul
there, or rather an agent, for he has not got an
exequatur. Assisted by twrelve interpreters, he does
wonders with the limited means at his disposal, but
as he is generally short of money and is obliged to
borrow from the Chinese to pay the staff, he cannot
do much to uphold French interests. The most he can
do is to keep up the few friends whom he has gained
for us by his personal influence and winning ways.
For his title of French agent weighs as nothing in the
balance compared to his personal popularity, so that
he is seconded but not feared, for it is known that he
cannot speak out, that his threats will remain a dead
letter, that he is not backed up, and that the Foreign
Office seems indifferent to the Mekong question.
Compare our mode of action to that of the English in Xieng
Mai, a Laos State bordering on Burmah and similarly
situated to Luang Prabang. At Xieng Mai there is
a Consul with an exequatur, that is to say duly
recognized by the native Government and his own, well
<!-- Leaf 84, Page: 68 -->
the quantity of their crops, forgetting that it was the
light quality and delicacy of their tobacco which had
caused it to sell so well; the result being that with
increased quantity the quality fell, and prices also.
Unless they revert to their former methods of
cultivation—and that is no easy matter, for the Chinese
coolie, who is paid according to the number of plants
he delivers, will be disinclined to sacrifice his profits
in order to ensure a higher quality, which is to him
a matter of indifference—the Deli planters will not
see a return of their palmy days. There are already
competitors in the field, notably Borneo, but as Borneo
has no native population all the labour has to be
imported, and it is very inferior and very expensive.
That country cannot, therefore, hope to succeed, and
that was my reason for leaving it.


\"This offers, if our governing authorities in Cochin
China only have a little foresight, a splendid
opportunity for endowing the country with an enterprise
which will be the certain cause of rapid wealth, and
will, above all, have the advantage of at once opening
the unexplored forest region of Upper Tonkin, and
preparing the way for the introduction of perennial
cultivations, such as coffee, cocoa, &c. Tonkin has all
that is needed for doing this; viz., agricultural labour
of good quality at a reasonable rate, which would
soon get to understand the methods of cultivation, an
admirable network of water-ways, and a good climate
by comparison with that of Borneo and Sumatra,
where the destruction of the forests has led to a
terrible increase of mortality. All that is needed is
an influx of capital."

of the ear, which forms a large fleshy ring, and their legs
are tattooed. The women wear a small embroidered
jacket; a deep blue turban with embroidered fringes
surrounds a chignon ornamented by two round silver
plates, joined by a small chain; chaplets of
transparent glass beads are wound round them. The
natives allow- us to photograph them.


About five o'clock the valley becomes shady, and
this is the best time of the day. AVith the exception of
a few rapids, at great intervals, the river is tranquil;
animals come out of the thicket and we shoot them
on the banks. Our boatmen point them out from a
distance and take much interest in the sport. They
are in good spirits, and chat from one pirogue to the
other, or sing in answer to the women, who are
bathing at the water's edge. The men inquire if
they are married, and invite them to follow them, in
case their hearts are free. The songs, often improvised,
are upon subjects referring- to love. They also try to
frighten the buffaloes that, half hidden in the water,
only show their back and the head which they hold
horizontally; but the great stupid animals pay no
attention to the shouts, they let us pass, contemplating
us with an air of fatalistic resignation; but they do
not move. In the evening our boatmen ask
permission to go to the village. AVe grant it and follow
them, however a few are left behind to keep watch
over the pirogues.


Here we shall have a first glimpse of the customs
of Laos; this strange country where love is held in
such great respect, that it might be called the kingdom
of the flirt. AVe walk up to the town, and find in the
centre a square platform raised upon four posts; from
<!-- Leaf 67, Page: 51 -->
massive buildings, denoting force and power, but
heavy; whereas in the French-built towns there is
always some little resemblance to Paris. Take for
instance, the Rue Paul Bert, with its rows of white
houses, two or three storeys high, its elegant shops
with cafes on the ground floor, and the trees on
the pavement, their green foliage standing out
against the whiteness of the houses, and with its
moving crowds of officers, civil functionaries, and
natives. The pousse-pousse is the ordinary mode of
locomotion, and it moves along at a very good pace;
but carriages are also used, though only by the higher
functionaries, the representatives of the
bankinghouses or the opium monopoly, and the rich
colonists, if such an adjective may be used in a
country where there is everything except capital.
The carriages generally used are light victorias, drawn
by two small horses of the country, which seem as if
they had been made to match in size the native
coachman or groom. There is also the mababar,
which is something like a coffin on four wheels. This
is the vehicle peculiar to the extreme East, from India
to China, and as it stops, followed by Annamites
riding horses with European saddles, there gets out a
native, whose clothes are little if any more elaborate
than those of his followers, but upon his breast are
the insignia'of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.
Taller than his escort, he is of the pale complexion
which in this country denotes the aristocracy, with
an intelligent but hard face, the line on the forehead

As for spun cotton the inhabitants buy more than
£400,000 worth of it. And we shall also be able
to sell garments and cloth stuffs, while we can
take the place of Setchuen and Burmah in their
export of silk to Yunnam, and of Setchuen and
Canton in that of tobacco. Salt w-ill be one of our
most important articles of trade, but of that I shall
have something to say below.


Some figures will give an idea of the movement of
O O
trade from Yunnam.


To the north over the route from Yunnam-Sen to
Sutchou (on the Yangtze) the trade movement through
a single custom house is £800,000 per annum.


To the east, over the route from Pai-See to
Canton and Pakoi, there went out in 1888 about
£560,000 worth of opium, £80,000 worth of tin, and
£320,000 of other articles, making in all about
£960,000. An equal amount of cotton, cotton goods
and other articles entered Yunnam, so that the total
trade amounted to £1,920,000.


To the w-est, even for tea alone the Puerh trade
amounts to £160,000, and farther on the Tali trade
with Burmah reaches half a million sterling.


From these examples the reader may judge of the
immense commercial future which lies within our
reach in a province scarcely yet recovered from the
ravages of the Mussulman war. And what wdl be
the case when native labour placed within reach of
the European engineer, after he has explored the
sub-soil, has revealed to the astonished world in the
Chinese hinterland a new California. Merely in
reading the random notes of travellers one is
astonished at the prodigious subterranean wealth

The Hotel Alexandre, which I may call the principal
one in Hanoi, without wishing to reflect upon the
others, is large and clean. This is the second time I
have stayed there, and the travellers and officials who
have not yet got settled into their houses mostly go
there. The walls of the rooms are white-washed, and
one sees a few little jekkofs running about and
uttering their plaintive cry. But they are said to bring
luck, and, besides, they give local colour to the scene.
The windows do not close properly, but it is not cold,
and all one has to do is to put one's valuables under
the pillow, lock one's door, and put the key in one's
pocket, for every traveller ought ever to have before
him the maxim of Dr. Pangloss. On the ground
floor is a large room with two billiard tables, and a
number of small tables, around which the French
element in Hanoi assemble to breakfast or dine, when
not invited elsewhere or at the club. It is a oreat
resort, too, for a " bitter " before dinner, the custom
being to play a game of cards or dominoes to decide
<!-- Leaf 248, Page: 232 -->
River, for I wish to reserve my views upon these
questions for the last chapter of my book.


Having left our collections and our heavy luggage
to be sent down to Hanoi, we have only a few
absolutely necessary things to take with us, and these
must be carried by porters. We have only to see
them loaded, to thank Deo Aran Tri for his kind
assistance, then steer for the west, on the road to
Mekong.
<!-- Leaf 434, Page: 418 -->
contraband), so we might very easily get repealed,
or drop, the article of our treaty relating to the
prohibition of salt, and our commerce would gain
considerably thereby.


By establishing the opium monopoly we have
ourselves interdicted its use as money, yet this is the
chief article of trade in China, and takes, owing
to its slight weight and high value, the place of coin.


According to Bourne, seven-tenths of the exports
of Kouang-Si and Kouangtoung to Yunnam are paid
in opium.


The government of Tonkin has just re-purchased
the opium monopoly. This is a good measure, if the
greater part of the duties on this product must
be taken off. But the substitution of a governmental
protectorate for the system of farming would become
absolutely useless were the tariff on opium sufficient
to keep up its price at as high a rate as in the past.


The establishment of customs tariffs has diminished
the introduction of foreign products without greatly
increasing our own. I read some months ago in one
of the Tonkin papers that 80 per cent, had been taken
off the entrance duties for merchandise in transit,
and this was a most necessary measure.


The Government has as yet, however, done too
little, if indeed it has done anything, to encourage
and develop the trade of Tonkin with China.


AVe did not, I imagine, take a colony merely as an
overflow place, to which our superfluous officials could
be shunted, but in order to colonise and to trade there.


Let us then imitate a little more our English
neighbours, who colonise and trade. AVhen we seized
Tonkin, Mr. Bourne immediately received a mission
<!-- Leaf 158, Page: 142 -->
ing as it were a T of which the river would be the
axis. When the tide is high the stones are covered,
but the bank, now some seventeen or twenty feet high,
is upon the level of the river and appears to be washed
by an immense lake.


The spot is well selected for a post which commands
the valley, and this is Van-Yen. AVe have just met a
part of the garrison upon an expedition, and when at
its full strength it consists of about forty Muong
sharpshooters and fifty Annamites. The first-named
are not so often sick as the latter, and although the
men of the two races do not assimilate, they do not
quarrel. Several non-commissioned officers do the
honours of the blockhouse, a small white building in
a poor state of repair, covered with inscriptions in
French and Chinese. The Annamite and Muong
villages, situated at the back, are quite distinct from
each other. Further ou, the valley of Phou-Yen,
fertile and filled with villages for a distance equivalent
to three days' march, opens up, but despite the
richness of the district the inhabitants have little to
complain of attacks from the pirates, these attacks being
rare and very partial. But here, as lower down, the
Doc-Ngu inspires great terror, for if he took a fancy
to the Phou-Yen he would put the post in a very
precarious position, for what could a garrison of less
than 100 men do against his formidable band?


As for ourselves we are pretty well at ease in this
respect, for which we cannot sufficiently thank M.
Vacle, my only regret being that his duties, which
enable him to render such valuable services to the
French Government, prevent him from going further
with us; and he himself, who is devoted to travel,
<!-- Leaf 76, Page: 60 -->
and Quang-Si, for which countries it could be
purchased at a lower price than the produce of the
Setchuen salt mines. By clause 15 of the Pekin Treaty
of 18S6 (signed by M. de Cogordan), the export of
salt to China was forbidden us, and this clause,
prompted by the solicitations of the Anglo-Chinese
Customs, was very prejudicial to our trade, as Mr.
Bourne was careful to point out in the interesting
narrative of his journey into the Yunnan.  
  
  
  CULTIVATION.


Although the many mines of Tonkin will some day
no doubt be a source of great wealth for the colonists,
I do not imagine that they will be the first source of
wealth, this being more probably the attribute of the
soil. This, which is of much the same composition as
that from which millions of Chinese derive their living,
is very productive, and may be made more so, when
embankment works, well regulated systems of
irrigation, the making of roads, and a feeling of security,
enable the inhabitants to extend their cultivation.
The Bay-Sai road had hardly been finished before
the natives applied for concessions in the district
which it traverses, and, in addition to the native crops,
experiments will be made on others. Nor will these
be confined to the delta, as upon the table-lands of
the mountain district the conditions of altitude and
climate will be found very favourable to the
development of certain plants.


Rice, in all its varieties, grows in the lowlands and
highlands, feeding the whole of Indo-China, as it does
half the universe, and " a rice field, a tuft of bamboo,
<!-- Leaf 306, Page: 290 -->
stacked one above the other. Chinamen live in these
floating establishments.


The bank only rises some fifteen yards, and the
shallow water scarcely hides a few sandbanks, while
the calm powerful river flows on in a muddy stream
more than 400 yards wide. Like a high mountain or
an old tree, the venerable giant of the forest, like
everything that nature has made grand and strong, it
produces a deep impression upon the traveller, which
imprints itself upon the mind and causes him to
pronounce its name with a kind of respectful awe.
It seems that a religious idea is attached to the broad
and tranquil Mekong, that it shares the sacred
brotherhood of the Nile, Ganges, Niger, and Mississippi, in the
past one of those rivers that have cradled the
nations who filled the history of humanity; in the
future one of the widest and deepest waterways open
to the extension of civilisation. Our boatmen stop
on the right side at a bamboo landing stage, a
staircase cut in the bank leads to an edifice built upon
piles and surrounded by large trees. It is a good sized
house made of strong wood, with a gallery round it
and a kind of kiosk in front, the walls and posts
are painted green and red, or green anel white; the
roof is covered with bamboo thatch, and from its
centre floats the trieoloured flag. AVe have arrived at
the French Consulate, which contains the office of the
company. M. Massie, and his second in command,
{empty}M. Counillon, live here, and the surrounding houses
are occupied by Cambodian interpreters; we are
received with open arms and lodged in the Consulate.
<!-- Leaf 189, Page: 173 -->

From Bau-Nahoum until the evening we notice little
variation in the landscape. It consists of grassy
undulations with a few small oaks, and here and there
hfllocks of earth from six to nine feet high, excrescences
on the land like gigantic mole-hills; these are
constructed by the termites.


We now approach the Deloustal mine; a fine view
includes the distant mountains of Thanoa, and we
pause to admire the prospect and at the same time
to glance at the copper bed.


A few holes have been made in a porphyric rock
under the direction of a lawyer from Hanoi, who took
the perimeter, but he did not try deeper than sixteen to
twenty feet. In the water I notice some sulphate of
copper of a beautiful green which pulverises and
crumbles under the finger; the vein is surmounted by
a layer of oxide of iron, which is called the cap of the
vein; it is found between the primitive strata and the
calcareous formations. Analogous characteristics are
found in the metallic beds of Nevada. However, the
Frenchmen who have been here have not yet
considered the vein worth the expense which would be
incurred in establishing and carrying on the necessary
works and transports, so at present the mine seems
abandoned.


We re-descend to a plain cultivated in rice fields, in
the midst of which chalky eminences in the form of
cylinders rise from the ground surrounded at their
base by a hedge of large trees. Nam-Xoung, where
we shall pass the night, is a large village containing
some twenty houses.


We are warmly greeted as usual; the chief comes
to meet us and installs us in a small compartment
<!-- Leaf 356, Page: 340 -->
of the ancient ramparts, while turning back in the
direction of the river, we have on our left the grounds
of several houses belonging to mandarins, and on the
right, at the foot of the hill, a group of pagodas well
worth a visit.


The most important of these is Ouate Uisoune, so
named after the king who built it. Dating, as the
Siamese Colonel tells us, from the fourteenth century,
it is in a very decrepit state, but there is much in it
worth seeing; notably the gates which are of carved
wood and gilt. To the right is Pra Noriei, the
fourarmed goddess, borne up by Kroute, the god of the
birds, and in the centre are two women, one of whom
is being carried by five elephants, while to the left
a god standing erect upon a buffalo is supposed to
represent the chief of the coolies who weed the
courtyards of the pagodas. In the interior are a number
of wooden columns covered with gilded designs
and others of masonry, together with pictures
representing the history of Pra Uetsandaha and of Guadama.
Upon the altar is a large gilt statue called Pratiao
Ong Luong (great god), and behind the altar is a
semicircular black stone upon a wooden pedestal and
covered with Laotian inscriptions. Upon one side of
this stone, it is related how the king of Muong Hay
(near Muong Yan), having come for a festival with
the king of Luang Prabang, left in the pagoda images
of Buddha and books made of palm branches about
1198. The date is 1198 after Tiaoman Ta, who is
supposed to have lived sixty-six centuries ago, so that
it is one difficult to verify. Upon the reverse is
a cabalistic sign which, worn by a soldier on the
<!-- Leaf 386, Page: 370 -->
caUed, is not large, having 780 inhabitants, including
women and children. The Siamese garrison is made
up of eighty men, and is shifted every three years.
The lieutenant lives in one half of a rather large
house, and the other half is occupied by Chinese
merchants.


Paklay owes its importance to its situation on the
Mekong at the extremity of the shortest route from
the Menam. In the neighbourhood there is a good
deal of teak which might be advantageously exploited.
AVild animals abound, stags and oxen being killed for
their antlers and horns. Some years ago, I am told,
a tapir was killed near here, but native information
is so little to be trusted that no confidence can be
put in this story, and I have never before heard it
said, moreover, that tapirs come so high up.


AVe gather information as to the route which we
are to follow- from the second King of
LuanoPrabang, who has just returned that way from
Bangkok. He lives near us in an enormous room,
which his baggage has transformed into a veritable
bric-d-brac shop. There are glass-globes, imitation
paper flowers under glass, European hats,
cookinoutensils, and cruets, indeed, a little of everything
which has attracted the prince in the way of European
civilisation. After living twenty-two months at
Bangkok, he is returning to Luang Prabang- slowly
byeasy stages. Elegantly turned out, he seems franker
than his brother, and after exchanging visits he sends
us a present of cocoanuts and bananas.


In the evening the Siamese lieutenant invites us to
a particularly original site. Upon a small terrace in
front of our verandah sit a dozen young girls, their
<!-- Leaf 382, Page: 366 -->
roof is high enough to permit one to stand erect
beneath it. The whole with its three compartments,
carries besides ourselves the interpreter, the boys, and
eight oarsmen; four of whom are in the prow, while
two have oars in the direction of the boat's axis to
guide it when in the rapids. AVe quickly settle
ourselves into this floating house, in one corner being our
beds; while in the middle is a table and some chairs,
and at one end an improvised oven, made of sand
and stones, which serves as kitchen.


After a fortnight of incessant activity at Luang
Prabang we are not sorry to rest aboard. The time
goes quickly. Our boatmen are amiable and reply
willingly to our questions. In the evening, as the nights
are superb, I question them on astronomy, and find
that they know most of the constellations. The Great
Bear they call the Elephant. The "bands of Orion "
go by the name of the Bow, because of the two small
stars at the side which suggest an arrow. Venus is
\"the star not loved by pigs," because, as they say,
it is so bright that pigs do not eat when they see it.


From the stars and the heavens we pass to the other
life. Upon this subject our crew refer us to the old
men for information. They themselves know little;
they believe that charitable people will be
recompensed,taking on another individuality after death, and
that the wicked will go to hell. " There are,
however, at Luang Prabang," they add, " some men who do
not believe in hell, who do not give to the bonzes,.
who drink tchoum-tchoum, and who smoke opium."


As for the five Siamese soldiers who follow us on
a small raft, we can get nothing out of them.
Attached to our suite by the Siamese Colonel, under

event of his being inclined to take action in the
O
matter."


A protest of the regents against this measure,
addressed to the French Government, was not
forwarded to Paris by M. Lemaire, and in 1886 M.
Chauffeur, fully persuaded as to the treaties
concluded with the Court of Hue holding good,
endeavoured to execute the first clause of it and to pay
100,000 piastres to the court before August 26. This
sum in specie was taken from Hanoi to Haiphong, and
from Haiphong to Hue, but as no one would receive
it, the money had to be brought back to Haiphong
and paid into court. The negotiations with M. Paul
Bert, which had got as far as a draft treaty, were
arrested by his death, and in March, 1887, M. Bavier
arrived at a compromise with M. Bihourd, though it was
only on April 27, 1888, that a definite act of concession
was passed, the company abandoning the Kebao domain,
and in exchange for the reduced territory conceded to
it foregoing the treaties signed with the Court of Hue.


The promises made by M. d'Arfeuille seem to have
been forgotten, and if, upon the one hand, he can
claim the right of discovery, as evidenced by the
report of M. Fuchs, upon the other hand his rivals
have the advantage of being in possession of a detailed
map of the coal-fields and of the treaty passed with
the Court of Hue previous to the insertion in the
Officiel of the proposed regulation of mines—a treaty
which had been practically recognised by the
representatives of the French Government who legalized
the deed. Be this as it may, one may well ask what
account had been taken of the second part of Clause
19, the text of which is as follows :—  
  
  
  D
<!-- Leaf 368, Page: 352 -->
the former taking up his place opposite the girl of
his fancy. This goes on until two in the morning,
being much like the flirtation of other countries, with
this difference that there is no dancing and that
conversation with the unmarried girls is more free
than with married women. In one of the pagodas we
visit, I can hear the prayers of the bonzes mingling
with the soft whisperings of the love-stricken swain,
one of whom delivers himself thus :—


\"Oh ! my love, you who are my very own heart,
I love none but you. It is you only whom I love.
You are white and green like the eggs of a crow. I
implore of you to be my life."


There are also certain games played at these
gatherings, one of these being very much like that
known to us as "questions and answers," w-hile there
is another played with bits of paper, which resembles
that of " mother goose."


The same festivals are celebrated on April 13th and
14th, except that it is the eastern pagodas which bring
in the new year and conduct it westward to Ouate
Tate Loung.


The 15th is a more interesting day for us, as the
king is to make a progress through the streets, the
•event being announced early in the morning- by two
of the four guns which the Siamese have mounted
here.


AVhen we arrive at the pagoda of Ouate Uisonne,
Ave find that the crowd is already very great, and
that women are bringing to the pagoda flowers and
meats placed in large dishes. From the street to the
entrance of the temple the path is covered with
bamboo mats; the peristyle is draped with yellow
<!-- Leaf 217, Page: 201 -->

Although we are astonished and dazzled, I am
conscious of another and a painful sentiment, I love
trees, I love forests; I have a devotion, a kind of
respect for woods, and, however beautiful it may be, I
cannot help feeling a pang of regret as I see the work of
destruction performed by these wild people, who wish
to enjoy to-day without thinking of the morrow. Those
who lighted the fire have only yielded to the necessity
of obtaining food. They clear a space for the
cultivation of their rice, and when the harvest is over they
go and repeat their ravages elsewhere, for space is not
lacking. The earth is full of life, and vegetation is
powerful in these climates, so a thicket will soon
recover the waste land. But how many years are
required before a giant ficus will again rear its
strong white trunk one hundred feet ?


After all, is improvidence for the future limited to
these poor Meos ? Is it the attribute of savage
races only ? And the incendiaries of the forests of
the Esterel, of the pines on the Alps or the Pyrenees,
should they not be considered still more guilty, on
account of the civilisation which ought to teach them
better things ? Before throwing stones at others let
us took at home, and we may, perhaps, become more
indulgent.


The night has been warm, the rocks hold the heat,
and encamped at the bottom of a large ditch we
suffer from it so much, that we hasten to start in the
morning, and are on foot at an early hour. The whole
day is passed in shooting the rapids, which succeed
each other almost uninterruptedly. The rocks which
line the banks bear clumps of azaleas, their red flowers
producing a superb effect. Some of our men gather
<!-- Leaf 219, Page: 203 -->
he is a tall, stout man, with a slightly flat nose, rather
bushy eyebrows, a few hairs on the chin, and a habit
of winking his left eye. From a racial point of view
he does not show any clearly defined type, but is rather
Chinese, mixed with Thais, and with something of the
Yunnan mountaineer. AVhatever origin his features
may betray, they indicate energy, strong will, great
intelligence, and above all power, the consciousness of his
strength. I have seen a great many Orientals and
of every kind, but I have never met one so European
elsewhere. By European I do not mean civilised, but
I mean a man who understands quickly, often with
only a hint, anything one wishes to say to him, and
who knowrs how to answer immediately, how to say
what is and what is not, wThat can be clone and wdiat
he believes to be impossible; in a word an Asiatic
with whom one can come to an understanding, or
rather know what one has to expect from him. For
although trustworthy and confiding to his friends, this
personage is not always easy to deal with, and he is
very cunning. With regard to us, he looks upon us as
brothers and acts towards us as he would do towards
{empty}M. Vacle, whom he adores. We have, therefore, every
reason to praise him. He even astonishes me by the
liberal manner in which he understands true
hospitality. We are not accustomed to such proceedings
amongst the Chinese, and, in my opinion, the study
of his character would be quite sufficient to show that
he was a half-caste. Such an assemblage of
apparently contradictory good qualities and defects can
only be found in people of mixed blood, who combine
in themselves the most varied atavic phenomena.  
  
  
  He is now in mourning for his father, who died a
<!-- Leaf 190, Page: 174 -->
at the extremity of his house. Here we are allowed to
pass to and fro and to stay and chat in the public
room, which we consider most interesting. The
men and women are squatted round two
fireplaces; the latter are generally ugly, and here, as in
Thibet, their features are less delicate, their faces
fuller and rounder than the men's. The young girls
wear their hair in a chignon behind the head, the
married women wear it on the top. Many of them
have a silver ring inserted in the lobe of the ear, to
which they suspend a second ornament. They are
now occupied in lacquering their teeth. A piece of
wood is held above the fire; when it is covered
with smoke-black it is scraped with a spatula and the
powder is used. A young man is playing a very
soft melody. His instrument is a small rectangular
sheet of copper in which a key is cut; silk cords are
attached to the two extremities, and the sounds are
obtained by the vibration of the metal against the
teeth. This instrument requires much practice before
it can be skilfully used.


I am able to make several purchases here, including
some costumes and twro manuscripts (black Thai);
they are collections of songs which are usually difficult
to obtain. A monkey is brought for us to buy, but
the species is common. The natives say that game is
plentiful in the neighbourhood, so we keep watch for
it as we travel, but the tigers do not show themselves,
though, at last, they make themselves heard, for
we are awakened in the middle of the night by a
frightful hubbub produced by the animals fastened
beneath the house. Every one gets up, the men go out
and light huge fires, which they keep up until the
<!-- Leaf 188, Page: 172 -->
pastures covering the chalky hillocks, then we enter
the woods; now penetrating the virgin forest with its
giant trees bound together by the inextricable
network of tropical creepers; now crossing a thinly sown
plantation of young oaks, amongst which I notice
some hazel bushes.


At Bau-Nahoum, where we lunch, I remark several
fishermen's huts. Each hut has a small garden planted
with vegetables in the front, and the land seems very
good everywhere. What fine unoccupied spaces these
would be for attempting cultivation on a large scale,
when the country had been pacified and the
communications with the Delta facilitated ! Cotton grows
here without any attention, and when planted upon
the heights or upon land cleared by burning the
annual arbuscles, it attains a height of nearly five
feet; it is sown in the spring and harvested in the
autumn, and it fetches three piastres the picul gross
weight.1 Each house, according to its importance,
should produce from seventy to one hundred pounds
yearly, but the natives here content themselves with
growing merely sufficient for their own requirements.
Maize and rice are also cultivated; wild fruits furnish
an oil, and a brown dye is obtained from a tubercle
frequently found on a level with the earth and
analogous to the truffle; this is the false gambir, called
cunao in Annamite. In Annam it is the object of an
important trade, and it is sold even upon the market
of Hong Kong. Cattle feed well upon the pastures,
pigs and buffaloes are also reared. The latter wear
wooden bells, made of a piece of bamboo with two
external clappers.

morning. A tiger has come within thirty yards of the
village, and is close to us; we hear his short jerky
breathing, the powerful rattle in his throat, from
time to time interrupted by a loud snapping of his
jaws; he approaches the house and at times seems
near, so I load my rifle. A crack in the wall at the
angle where I sleep serves as a loophole; but the
moonlight is superb, and the animal, seeming to
mistrust it, will not leave the thicket, but contents
himself with keeping us awake until daybreak, when
he slowly withdraws, roaring at intervals as he goes.  
  
  
  \8th February.


In the afternoon the road is bad; at every cross
turning the guide, who precedes us, indicates the
right way by barring the others with branches that
he breaks on purpose. After passing through some
tall grass we reach a region of calcareous rocks,
exactly resembling those of the Along Bay; and
henceforth, in going round these cliffs, we are obliged to
travel in continual zigzags. For some hours we follow
the bed of a torrent, then we cross a small river,
the Nam Pan, in which my horse falls awkwardly.
Luckily I escape with only my saddle-bags wet
through, for nothing is lost, and the sun will soon
repair the misfortune. A little higher up this river
issues from a mountain, after flowing beneath it for
several furlongs. The district would be a curious study
from a geological point of view; it has been moved,
shaken, overthrown, and looks as if a formidable
disturbance had taken place. Everywhere we see chaos,
rubbles, holes and caverns; to the latter I owe the
<!-- Leaf 123, Page: 107 -->
several years in the district of the Notre Dame rocks,
considered to be a very dangerous one, without
having ever been attacked by the pirates, while the
natives, so far from molesting him, often called him
in to arbitrate between them. Promoted, after
having belonged to the Pavie Mission, to the post
which he now occupies at Cho-Bo, M. Vacle is
bound, from his wide experience and notoriety, to
render considerable service to the Government. We
are given quarters in the post, where wre settle
ourselves on the day after the departure of the steamer
and its passengers, and it is not without a certain
sense of satisfaction that I see the last link which
connects us with the self-styled world of civilisation
snapped asunder. Before going up the Black River,
we are compelled to make a halt of several days here.
The spot is a pleasant one, though we are told that
it is unhealthy at certain seasons, the thermometer
varying from 50° to 77° Fahr. The enemy most
dreaded by the few Europeans, such as postal employes
and the representative of the opium monopoly, who
have to reside at Cho-Bo, is, moreover, not so much
the sun, or even fever, as the Doc Ngu; the garrison
is insufficient, and the place is at the mercy of a
sudden descent of that terrible pirate chief whose
hitherto unconquered bands infest the delta formed
by the Black and the Red rivers. The recollection of
the terrible drama of which Cho-Bo was the theatre
over a year ago is still very vivid, and the ruins
of the former Residency are yet standing witnesses
of what occurred through the incompetence, the
blindness, and the obstinacy of French officials,
viz., the decapitation of M. Rougerie, the Resident,
<!-- Leaf 337, Page: 321 -->
similar to those which are found in the interior of
Borneo. Then there are amulets, wild boar tusks,
pyrites, and fossils rolled up in thin silver thread,
some of these latter being supposed to possess the
power of fecundation, while others are obscene.


The industries special to the country are represented
by silver work, cups for the temples, tobacco jars,
apparatus for crushing the betel nut, and knife
handles. These articles are made of gold for
personages of very high standing, but only to order.


The scarves which are celebrated in Indo-China,
embroidered by hand with a great variety of design,
and in very harmonious colours, denote great taste.
After the saleswomen have folded their goods and
packed them up to take aw-ay, some of them lag
behind and tell us that they are themselves for sale
at twenty-five or thirty rupees.


Then come the bonzes, one of whom, a big, fat
man, with a bosom as protuberant as that of a woman,
is a very important personage, as his small violet
petticoat indicates. Satouk Camdi, as he is called,
has a frank, cheerful face and strong voice, which he
makes ample use of to ply us with questions. Once
settled down, with his porters who carry sunshade,
fan, &c, it seems as if we should never get rid of
him. My proposal to photograph him is very
gleefully accepted, and he at once makes his brother and
sister sit for their portraits as well.


At first, we received several visits from an aged
bonze, also occupying an important position, who
had been for many years friendly to the French.
\"They are fathers and brothers to me," he would say.
During the second half of our visit, he had been

luncheon, shooting expeditions on land, while the
boat is passing the rapids, a little fishing;
amusements are not lacking and the weather is fine. We
have minima of 59° F., and maxima of 86° F.
in the shade during the afternoon and no
annoyances, on condition that one is patient. Great
tranquillity is compulsory; it is almost a contemplative
life, and it has its advantages... provided there is
not too much of it. During the afternoon halts our
boatmen cut down some branches, tie them together
and throw them into the water, with stones to keep
them at the bottom. They take them up when they
leaA'e and pick out the fresh-water prawns which have
lodged in them, and which provide them with a good
meal in the evening.


With regard to sport, we are not lucky. A few
otters, which our men call dogs that go in the water,
some monkeys, and a magnificent peacock are all
missed; our unskilfulness has one excuse, for we shoot
wuth rifles from a distance and as we move. Our men
capture a water tortoise; the shell is flat and less
hard than in the land species, the beak is pointed, the
feet webbed for swimming. It is a young- one, not more
than twelve inches long, while some are found of more
than a yard. Thou, who in his profession as traveller
often acts as cicerone, calls it tirte, or five-footed
animal; he tells us that the flesh is fatal to any one
suffering from syphilis.  
  
  
  February 2Gth.


In the afternoon the hills are lower, and their
summits are usually denuded of wood. We begin to
meet some people, for we are now approaching a large
<!-- Leaf 364, Page: 348 -->
the usual prayers, enter a sort of shed surrounded by
planks and having upon the top the same water
conduit which has been used for sprinkling water
over the gods. The women pour their water into
this conduit, which flows down over the priests, who
emerge from the shed purified and washed, but
dripping wet, though this they do not seem to mind.
This ceremony over, the dances begin, and two men
emerge from the pagoda enveloped in vast cloaks
coming clown to their heels which are meant to
designate the skin of some wild animal, while they
have on their heads a mask of black wood representing
some monster with enormous eyes, large mouth with
very sharp teeth, very long ears and a lower jaw
which can be moved at will. Behind the head is a
long mane of coarse hair, and we are told that they
are known as Pi Konge, or devils with a cruel face,
while the old bonze says that they are the chiefs of
the tigers, or the Pi Sua (race of devils). The
Siamese Colonel adds that in the Laos they are known
as Pou Yen (from Pou, father) or Ya Yen (from Ya,
mother), and there is a legend that men of this kind
once lived in a large forest, and that though they
inspired great terror two of them were captured,
these monsters representing the captive pair. It is
interesting to compare this native tradition with the
assertion of several travellers that the Laos was
formerly inhabited by a hairy race of men.


AVhatever be the origin of these two "monsters,"
they seem to amuse the crowd very much, and when
after having knelt in front of the pagoda and wished
the spectators a happy new year, they begin to dance,
I am surprised beyond measure to find that it is the
<!-- Leaf 282, Page: 266 -->
earth in which some openings have been made, a wall
in the centre surrounds a block of masonry seven or
eight yards in diameter which supports a dome of
white plaster, with gilt ornaments. Above it, there
is a cone made of seven gilded circles, surmounted by
a point, the whole edifice may be about fifteen feet
high, and I remark some small reliquaries
containino- rough statuettes, of which the faces are half
obliterated. The natives, whom I question, tell me
that it is a fort, and in truth, a few cannons in that
position, could easily command both sides of the
valley, but at present they are missing. However, in
my opinion, the monument is of religious origin; it
reminds me of similar edifices in Thibet; but I
cannot obtain any information either upon the date
or the object of its construction.


As I walk down by the side of the river I find a
very animated scene; prisoners are going to and fro
with manacles on their legs, which do not seem to
inconvenience them at all. Elsewhere, men are making
rafts and cutting planks; some of them are sawing a
tree; they work horizontally, in pairs, putting in
wedges as they advance. AVomen are fetching water
in buckets made of bamboo tubes; they take the
opportunity of bathing, and do not seem hindered by
any bashful feelings. There is a curious remark to
make on this point: amongst the Thais of the Black
River, the men never hesitate to strip themselves, and
enter the water; but the women appear more
reserved; here, on the contrary, they are the ones that
feel no shame, whilst their husbands seem to avoid
undressing- in our presence. AVhat can be the cause
of this inversion of sentiments ? is it clue to a
<!-- Leaf 143, Page: 127 -->
differ
The luggage having been stowed away, all we
have to do is to get on board. Five canoes are
sufficient for our accommodation, the longest
measuring about thirty-three feet by five, with wooden
hulls running to a point and elevated at the two
extremities, reminding one somewhat of a gondola. At
the stern is a round wicker cage containing a cock,
placed there either to be eaten one clay or to be
offered as a sacrifice to the evil spirits. Underneath
this is a small, short steering-wheel, the handle of
which is left in its place between the feet of the
helmsman. The boat is not very deep in the water,
as there are certain passages which can only be got
through with very little draught, while the baggage
is stowed in the bottom, and mats are arranged to
enable us to sit down, and, for the greater part of the
time, to lie at full length, the covering of twisted
bamboo being so low that we can scarcely sit upright
even with our legs crossed Turkish fashion. We must,
however, try and make ourselves as comfortable as
possible, for it is slow work going up stream, and we
shall have to spend several weeks in this
uncomfortable residence. We get on pretty well, however, and
travel teaches one to be industrious, and, with our
mattresses in the fore part of the boat, our rifles,
carbines, and revolvers hung wp at our sides on iron
hooks, we are not so badly off, if a trifle short of
room. But we are protected from the sun above,
and from the moisture beneath, with plenty to occupy
us and enough to eat.


Outside the covering are the men, two upon each
side, all of them being provided with a bamboo pole
thirteen or sixteen feet long, with an iron tip. The
<!-- Leaf 235, Page: 219 -->
with a rack, they are fed upon maize. The
population is amiable and receives us well; we are even
offered a Chinese meal. The men are tall, of the
mountaineer type, energetic and open, with a large
forehead, prominent cheekbones, and slightly oblique
eyes; they recall the Meos in appearance. Their
costumes are not remarkable in any way, but the
women wear small broad black drawers, ornamented
with white designs, an apron, and a jacket ended by
two wide lappets, and cut like a Robespierre coat;
cowries or white beads are sewn on the back, and
long silken fringes fall over the front. I have never
seen this curious dress anywhere else. They usually
wear a large turban, but on state occasions they put
on a hat of a kind of oil-cloth which forms an
immense visor; the chignon is then waxed, hardened,
and gathered into a small peak, upon which they
place the curious headdress; two points passing from
the extremity of the peak rest upon the forehead;
they use Chinese foot-gear. Their dialect is quite
different from the Meo language; they are divided into
Lam Tin Yaos and Tinpan Yaos; the former wear the
hair Annamite fashion, the latter have the pigtail.


The people of Tafine tell us that eighty years ago
they came from Quantoung. The table-land was
densely populated at one time, but the inhabitants
took fright when they heard of the arrival of the
French and fled away; they are now beginning to
return. Here they live by agriculture and commerce.
Our hosts possess six mules, and their caravans
fetch cotton from Nam-Ma and carry it to Yunnam,
where they obtain bars of iron, saucepans, and opium
(iron is sold for five piastres the picul at Mong-Tze).
<!-- Leaf 273, Page: 257 -->
ment of the wild yaks; they can only be attributed
to bisons or rhinoceros. I am told that black bears
are often met with in these mountains, and I see
an animal fleeing from me, which I think is a
wolf, but I cannot shoot it. Tiger tracks are very
frequent.


The road to-day is still worse than yesterday, the
march through the bamboos is particularly tiring,
for we risk blinding ourselves at every step, and when
we descend the hdl the path is one prolonged slide,
besides, we have to squeeze through narrow places,
and to force a passage between the entangled and
frequently thorny creepers.


AATith a lively feeling of satisfaction we emerge
upon a cleared track two yards wide. Everything is
relative; we can believe that we are now in a fine
road, so we lift our heads and breathe again. From
this point the territory is subject to the authority
of Siam.


There are a few clearings on the heights, but the
country we are entering is not so wild as the region
we have left, a river about thirty yards wide flowrs at
our feet; opposite, a temporary village formed of a
few houses shelters the people who cultivate the
ricefields. AVe encamp in a glade, a little rain is falling,
and it is the first rain we have seen for a long time,
but our improvised huts of banana leaves prove
sufficient protection.


Our porters are tired after their day's work, for
they have marched well; they belong to the Thais or
Sas races. One of them has three blue circles
tattooed upon his breast, which he conceals with his
hand when any one approaches to look at them. He  
  
  
  s
<!-- Leaf 168, Page: 152 -->
seeking either glory or reward, carried the flag of
France into distant regions. This man, at least, has
the consolation of resting upon French soil.


We are getting near to a post-house, and we meet
a canoe which has come down from Van Bou, with a
sergeant and a few linhs, to fetch a convoy of piastres
at Van Yen. The sergeant, who has been in Tonkin
three months, tells us that, in the course of the first
night he passed at Van Bou four tigers entered the
post-house and devoured a goat and several pigs.  
  
  
  February Wth.


The weather remains fine, and is not too hot for
comfort, the light being soft and not trying to the
eyes. The trees seem to melt away at their tops
into the azure of the sky, and there is something
very soft and soothing to the gaze in the air. It is
so different from those African regions, where, side
by side with a dazzling sun, are sharp contrasts of
deep shadow. Here the sun is very treacherous, for,
despite its mitigated light, it is more to be feared
than that of Africa, and we are obliged to wear a
sunhelmet, while many of our men, accustomed to the
kepi in Algeria, have learnt to their cost that so light
a head-covering will not do in Tonkin.


While we are at breakfast, the awning of a canoe
held up by two poles serves as a shelter, and we
choose as a halting place a sandbank as near as
possible to a wood so as to have a chance of getting
a few shots.


We have a guest to breakfast to-day, or rather
a spectator, for he does not condescend to move
<!-- Leaf 198, Page: 182 -->
tractor, who gave us the information about the works,
told me that his Chinese father had seven or eight
hundred workmen of his fellow countrymen, and he
earned a great deal; but some piracy occurring, he
departed with his money without troubling himself
about his wife and son. The speaker added that if he
had any money he would increase his works and thus
make a great fortune, but that the French ought to
come here; they could engage Thais coolies for about
three piastres per month (food and opium being
provided), but that there was much more to do at
Yetong, about four miles above Van Bou; the bed
seemed richer and was completely abandoned.  
  
  
  February 19th.


Having seeii some of the mining works in the
morning, we leave Molou after our coolies, the road,
which we follow, often leading us through woods,
passing from hillock to hillock, from circus into
circus, by continual ascents and descents; it is quite
one of the worst that I have yet met with. It would
be even dangerous at night, for the ground is pierced
with holes, that are so numerous in certain places,
that there is scarcely room to pass without falling
into one of them. The openings are often half hidden
by brambles or grass, and some of the wells, the
remains of former gold workings, are from five to
six yards deep; so travellers must be careful.


At the top of a small hill we see several men
apparently commencing a new mine. An old man
and his two sons are digging an excavation round the
roots of some bamboos; but they tell us that they
<!-- Leaf 309, Page: 293 -->
established themselves there for good a few years ago,
when they learnt that the French were approaching
from the direction of Tonquin. I have already related,
when speaking of Deo A7an Tri, the ambush set for his
brothers, the Siamese officers being accompanied by
an Englishman, one McCarthy, who, with another of
his compatriots, had been appointed agent at Luang
Prabang. I have also referred to the meeting of French
and Siamese troops in the plain of Theng, and the
retreat of the latter. AVe were not able to push on
any further, for the aged king of Luang Prabang, who

became tributary to Siam. The Siamese authority in the Shan
States consisted in arranging their external affairs and
sanctioning the nomination of their chiefs. In return for the protection
of Siam against the foreign invaders, three States consented
to send a triennial tribute, consisting of gold and silver boxes.
chased cellarettes and salt-cellars, as well as gold and silver
trees worth from fifteen to thirty-five pounds each. To these
statements of Hallett as to the early date at which Luang
Prabang became tributary to Siam, I would rejoin that the
chronicles of Luang Prabang, which have been consulted by
{empty}M. Pavie, do not contain any allusions to Siam at an earlier
period than the last half-century. The Lai chronicle, to which I
referred above when dealing with Deo Van Tri, only alluded to
the state of dependency in which the King of Luang Prabang
stood with regard to Annam.


{empty}M. Deschanel would seem to have anticipated the views
suggested, if not openly expressed by Hallett, Colquhoun and Lord
Lamington, when be wrote in 1885 : " The day that England
seizes Burmah, our authority in the eastern part of the
IndoChinese peninsula will receive a severe shock. If we do not take
our precautions (in the Upper Laos), the English, once established
at Xieng Mai (in Siamese Laos) will be masters, morally
speaking, of the valley of the Mekong and the important position of
Luang Prabang, which was tributary to Annam. Thus cut off
from the great river, in danger of seeing England secure the
protectorate of Siam, our situation in Indo-China will be very
much weakened."—Compare Garnier above.
<!-- Leaf 412, Page: 396 -->
of the country. There remains the question of trade,
which I have kept to the end, in order to sketch
the main lines of it, as the general conclusion
resulting from my reading and from my personal
observation during two journeys.


The watchword of Gamier and his successors who
with him laid clown their lives in the work to which
they were devoted, was :  
  
  
  To penetrate into China. Is it justifiable ?


Open a map of Asia. China, washed by the Pacific
for some hundreds of miles, ceases in the
southeast to be maritime, and penetrates inland until it
touches Indo-China. Lower down, the coast line juts
out afresh up to the point of Cochin-China. At the
limit of the peninsula and of the Celestial Empire,
bathed by the gulf, which marks the end of one bend
and the beginning of another, a province runs inland
to the north-west, like a wedge driven between the
two countries. This is Tonkin, the geographical
position of which, upon the slopes of Eastern Asia,
like a bung in a barrel, is alone sufficient to render
it the point of communication with the richest
provinces of China, the port where their products
seem to find a natural outlet.


This conclusion, arrived at by a mere glance,
becomes inevitable when the map is scrutinized more
closely. Tonkin is not only well situated, it has
good water communication with routes of direct
penetration, perpendicular to the coast, as straight and
as clearly marked as if they had been drawn on a
map with a ruler.  
  
  
  But this is not enough.  
  
  
  Can these valleys be practically utilized ?
<!-- Leaf 200, Page: 184 -->
exactly resembles a Noah's Ark. You can judge from
its dimensions : it is seventy yards long, thirty wide,
and more than ten yards high with the roof. The
walls are of straight boards pierced by small
windows; there are even shutters. The woodwork
of the roof is very curious; the opposite slopes are
joined at the extremities by a kind of half cone, cut
lengthways, supported by a series of bamboos arranged
in horizontal and parallel curves. One smooth section
entirely intersecting the roof would thus obviously
produce the image of an ellipse; the leaves which
cover it are laid over the exterior like the slates with
us. The interior is very clean. A large partition of
boards entirely separates one-third of the dwelling
from the rest and this is reserved for strangers. In the
portion occupied by the chief, lateral partitions form
a kind of cabin, used by the women. One room, closed
by a large green blind, contains the altar of the
ancestors; a rack holds the rifles of the militiamen
(there are thirty of them). At the side, are some
large green parasols, the insignia of command, with
the palanquin, which consists of a hammock, suspended
by a bamboo, and protected from the sun by a canopy
gilded and ornamented at each extremity. Our host
seems rich; he even owns some European articles, a
hanging lamp, an almanac, a table, some chairs, and a
clock of which he appears very proud, for when we
arrive he gets upon a chair to make it strike. We
find ourselves the guests of a generous man, too
generous even to please us. I dare not try to buy
anything. A woman's costume, some animals' skins,
some living birds (amongst others a very interesting
partridge), whatever we wish for is at once offered
<!-- Leaf 243, Page: 227 -->
comes from Hanoi, and is sold for four or four and a
half piastres the picul.


Fishing is carried on as well as these commercial
operations and agriculture. The river is very full of
fish. AVe certify this ourselves by throwing in a
cartridge of Favie powder; in a moment we have
filled more than five baskets with fish, amongst them
I remark some superb carp, similar to those of our
countries.


A few hundred yards beyond the village the
NamMa throws itself into the Song-Bo. At the confluent of
the two rivers three pirogues sent by Deo Van Tri are
waiting for us : we dismiss our coolies after paying
them (twelve cents each man per diem, and three
cents each for food), and send our horses back
by land. AVe then embark to recommence the
voyage already made to Laichau which takes a
clay and a half. Our boats are very small, and badly
laden so that we cannot sit down in them, the least
movement makes them turn, and it is with much
pleasure that I see the promontory of Lai appear in
sight. During our absence the great bamboo carcase
that ornamented the tomb of Deo Van Seng has fallen,
a gust of wind has blown it clown, and one of Deo
Aran Tri's brothers, Camhoung, has broken his
leghunting. AVe are told that to cure it the bone has
been laid bare, and a pulp of chickens newly hatched
and then crushed has been applied to the wound, and
carefully bandaged over it, yet the invalid believes in
a speedy restoration.


The newspaper also tells us that two French
officers have passed here and are now at six hours
distance, at Nam-Muong, the former residence of Deo
<!-- Leaf 64, Page: 48 -->
can reach, excepting a few clumps of palm-trees
or bamboos which form a curtain as it were to
some village. The dykes, which require great labour
to maintain them in repair, keef> back the waters,
so that part of the land remains unproductive. We
are told that an effort is to be made to raise the
level by mud deposits, in which case an experiment
might be made, upon a small scale, of the project of
{empty}M. Alavoil, who is the engineer at the head of the
service in Hanoi. He proposes to intersect, from the
upper delta to the sea, all the dykes at the jioints
where the rivers or their affluents flow through marshy
land. By letting only a thin stream of water pass,
the villages situated upon the higher lands would not
be inundated, and an alluvial deposit would be lodged
each year upon the low-lying ground, 7i/ millions
acres now unproductive being thus fertilised. The
proposal is one which well deserves being explained,
recalling as it does the work which the Nile has accomplished
every year in Egypt for so many centuries.


Beyond the monotonous plain, there is visible to
the left a natural elevation which the eye has been able
to distinguish during nearly all the journey from Hanoi
to Haiphong, this being the Elephant Mountain, so
named on account of its shape.


One gets tired of contemplating- this dome, always
the same, and always, apparently, as far off as ever.
There is more variety in the spectacle to be seen on
the banks of the river, with the gray or pink buffaloes
walking slowly along or stopping to watch the steamer
with an air of stupid indifference, and the little boys
running along and executing all sorts of contortions in
the hope of getting a few pieces of money thrown to
<!-- Leaf 355, Page: 339 -->
that the bones of a mandarin named Tianone are
laid to rest inside it, and the edifice is surrounded by
pillars, surmounted by lotus flowers, and looking very
much like large asparagus.


This brings us to the confluent of the Nam Kane,
which is not more than 130 feet broad, and is only
accessible to canoes of light draught, whereas if there
was more water, it could be utilized for the transport
of goods as far as Luang Prabang. From Vinh to
this latter place, the journey now takes about thirty
days and the region situated between the coast of
Annam and the Mekong is a very fertile one. This
is the plateau of Pouon, which is in the possession of
an European climate, the vine, fruit trees, melons and
other European plants thriving well there. The
country is a very healthy one, and there is a
prosperous future before the intelligent colonists who
know how to go to work.


Going up the stream as far as the point where the
two rivers meet, we came to the movable bridge built
upon piles, which leads to the village of Pan Luong
and beyond that, quite at the south of the village,
the manufactory of tchoum-tchoum. This liquor is
obtained by putting water and rice into earthenware
jars, and letting it ferment for a fortnight; at the
end of that time the contents of the jars are placed,
together with a little yeast, into wooden casks
surmounted by a large vat full of water. By a
somewhat complicated process, the liquor known as
tchoumtchoum is obtained and sold at the rate of two ticals
per gallon. This part of the town is very sparsely
inhabited, a few ruins on the track indicating the site

merchants, who, encouraged and aided by the advice
and patriotic zeal of M. Haas, our consul at Han-Kou,
Ichang, and Chung-King, are about to found a

O" O O'
comptoir'va. the large town of the Upper Yangtze and
make our industry known as far as the borders of
Thibet.


May a deserved success crown their useful
undertaking, and may they thus serve in the best way,
possible, that is in a practical and peaceful one, the
cause of France in the far East.


To sum up, the Yangtze route, which I may style
the route of lateral penetration, need not alarm
our merchants, for, on the one hand, it cannot
advantageously compete w-ith the Red River route in
the region of Yunnam, and, on the other hand,
beingopen also to our commerce, it will afford full facility
if need be, for the expansion of French trade, in the
provinces on the left bank of the great stream.


The Burmah Route.—This route, the route of
ascending penetration, is, in the nature of things,
much less to be feared than the preceding one.


AVhen the English seized Upper Burmah they were
disappointed at finding that the upper courses of
the rivers could not be made much use of for
navigation.


The route from Bhamo to Tali by way of
Tengyueh, although so short (295 miles) had to be given
up. The natural obstacles resulting from the fact
that it crosses high mountain chains and deep valleys
would have required too much labour and money to
render it practicable. The same thing was true of the
routes from Mandalay to Tali by way of Theabau and
from Hlinedet to Xienghoung through Mone. It

This plant grows well here, and one sees it everywhere
about the villages, rank as weeds.


After leaving Muong Liep we camp at the right of
the river near a sand-bank covered with the remains
of former encampments. A hundred paces off is a
large pond some 150 feet broad and of considerable
length. It owes its name to its green waters,
nong kiou (green pond). In the month of February
people come from all directions, and even from Luang
Prabang, to camp on its edge and to fish. Many big
fish are caught here, but now, we are told, they are
in a cavern which extends under the sand-bank. I
do not know how true this may be, but it is certain
that in w-alking on the sand and striking it, a hollow
sound is heard. Before fishing two bullocks are
sacrificed to the dragon of the lake, and
tchoumtchoum is drunk.


AVhen we talk of fishing ourselves with dynamite
our boatmen dissuade us : " they cannot dive because
of the dragon."


In the night we have a storm and rain, as the
season is beginning to change.


On the following morning we reach Paklay. The
river here is broad with sand-banks on either side
and water just covering the top of the rocks. The
village is situated on the right bank. The piles
which support the houses are hid by a net-work of
bamboo, arranged also to shut in the animals. A
fairly clean hut is set apart for us, as we are to
stay here for a day. The Siamese lieutenant has
ordered our elephants, but we cannot have them
before to-morrow-, so I employ a part of the day in
taking photographs. The town, if so it may be

other. A string stretched across the animal's path
puts the whole system in motion; the arrows are
short, and the iron point is coated to its base with a
resin which, they tell us, is a strong poison.


The men hunt, smoke, and drink, leaving the
household work to the women, who, however, do not
look very miserable. They carry their burdens in
dossers made of plaited bamboos, and slung over
their shoulders by means of braces. The Kas, who
also use dossers, take the nape of the neck as their
lever by employing a head-band secured round the
forehead. The Meos are extraordinary pedestrians,
and trot about the mountain like goats; but their
customs must not be interfered with. If any one
wishes for the services of a convoy of coolies, the
burdens must be so divided that they can be placed
in the dossers; the)* do not know how to carry
anything between two porters by means of a bamboo.


They do not seem far advanced from an intellectual
point of view. Their traditions date back only sixty
years, when, driven away by famine, they left the
mountains of Yunnan. They claim to be divided into white
Meos and black Meos; and this grouping resembles
the analogous distinction of the Lolos of Setchuen
(white bones and black bones).


Their dialect, of which an officer, M. Talboux, has
kindly given me a vocabulary,1 seems to differ very
little from that of the Meos of Traninh, of which I
picked up a few words; but I do not find any
connection between their language and those of the
Yaos, Lolos, and Mios-Tze, which different travellers

<!-- Leaf 52, Page: 36 -->
the town of Hong-Hay not caring to have recourse to
Haiphong for its iron-work and building or to submit
to the high terms of contractors. The growing town
means to depend upon its own resources, and the day
is perhaps not far distant when there will be custom
for its workshops from outside.


Having left our baggage at the elegant little
residence of M. Bavier-Chauffour, we go to breakfast with
{empty}M. Durrant, who lives rather higher up, in a white
house surrounded by a garden laid out with taste,
which reminds me of some with which I am familiar
in France.


There is no time to be lost, as the train is waiting
to take us to Nagotna.1 The distance is only three
miles, and the line passes from one small hill to the
other, the intervening valley being covered with
marine plants which are under water at high tide.
There are no bridges from one hill to the other, the
line being carried over embankments, through which
O ' O
drains have been made to let oft' the surface water.


The cost per mile of this line (exclusive of
rollingstock) has been £1,920, and it is instructive to note
that this line, though of forty inches gauge,
constructed by a private company, has cost less per mile
than the Phu-lang-Tuong line of only two feet gauge
constructed by the State,


1 The total concession is about 75,000 acres, with twenty
miles of coast. The breadth is as far as the limit of the
coalfields, which is a very indefinite one, and the concession is divided
into three lots, which, according to the terms of the contract,
must all be worked. These three lots, going from west to east
are Nagotna, Hatou and Campha, this latter lot having been
surveyed, though there is not sufficient protection against pirates
to admit of regular work.
<!-- Leaf 94, Page: 78 -->
many different hands. It is a pity that those who
have colonial questions at heart cannot read the private
reports as to matters of this kind, for they would
then see how the interests of the State are treated
by those whose first mission it should be to
protect them. It is not only in the works undertaken
for preparing the road that there has been culpable
neglect, but the transports from Phulang-Tuong to
Langson were conceded for two years to a contractor
at the rate of about five shillings a ton, and when,
at the expiration of the two years, they were put up
to contract, they wTere accepted by another contractor
at just a third of the price.


I am now told that, thanks to the authority of the
Governor-General, the works are making good
progress and that the forty-inch gauge will probably
be substituted for the two feet one. AVhen M. de
Lanessan visited the Hong-Hay mines, he was
surprised at the small cost of laying down a mile of
forty-inch line, the work being done by a company
which had its own interests to study. But between
Phulang-Tuong and Langson the work was
beingdone by the State, which was considered fair game
for every one.


In brief, the construction of the railway was in
the first instance estimated at £160,000, and it has
already cost double; while we may deem ourselves
lucky if it is completed for another £160,000.
Although the ground is level and there are no great
material difficulties in the way, less than five and
twenty miles in a straight line have been laid in
two years, while in the same period the English
have constructed five times the length in a very
<!-- Leaf 38, Page: 22 -->
a million, these figures appearing very small by
comparison with those of Hong-Kong, where the English
do a trade of forty millions sterling, It is true that
Hong-Kong has fifty years' existence, and that the
port has not always been very prosperous, passing
through many a severe crisis which has only been
surmounted by the energetic perseverance of the
tradingcolony. We hold an exceptional position in command
of a route by which we can penetrate into China, and
we ought to take advantage of it, but if we are ever
to attain a commercial prosperity anywhere
approaching that of Hong-Kong we must have a deep water port
accessible to vessels of any size. The vessels once in
smooth water, the goods which they bring must be
got into the country. In this connection, a question
which naturally suggests itself is—Why did we take
Tonkin ? In the first place, in order to gain access
into China, but this primary object seems to me to
have been quite lost sight of. The English tried hard
to make Hong-Kong a point of transit, but although
for twenty years their efforts were unprofitable they did
not, when once the receipts began to exceed the cost,
attempt to modify the situation. Hong-Kong had
been created a free port, and it has remained such.
It was the same with Singapore, and our town of
Saigon owed its prosperity to its free trade until
protective duties proved its ruin. A colony is not unlike
a child, whose mother, the metropolis, must lead, rear
and protect it until, having grown up and gained
strength, it is able in its turn to repay the care which
has been bestowed upon it, We have been in too
great a hurry to make the child pay his way, and
have endeavoured to render him productive before he

to which: " English and other merchandise may
freely circulate as far as Chung-King, after having
paid entry dues at Shanghai."


A town of more than 200,000 souls, situated at
the junction of the Yangtze and one of its tributaries
which comes from the centre of Setchuen, through
some of the richest provinces of China,
ChungKing is destined, if only because of its position, to
become one clay, if I may use the English expression,
the Liverpool of the East, the great emporium of the
Chinese hinterland.1


At present the steam navigation of the Yangtze
stops at Ichang, and the Chinese Government has
promised the European powers that it shall be
extended as far as Chung-King, as soon as possible.
From Ichang to Chung-King in junks is a matter

of twenty-five days, and from Chung-King to
Sutcheou, in smaller vessels, of fourteen.


Suppose again Lao-Kai reached from the coast in
two days, wdiich, I repeat, may be accomplished
whenever we please, the port of Tonkin will then be sixteen
days from Yunnan-Sen, twenty-three clays from
the Yangtze,2 and twenty-nine days from
Houi-liTcheou, one of the large towns of south-western
Setchuen. This route, by way of Yunnan-Sen,
Luhenghay (on the Yangtze) and Houi-li-Tcheou, is
taken by the caravans which bring Burmah and

the population furnished by Shanghai.


Hosie says, that the annual exports of Chung-King would
amount to £5,000,000 sterling.

in six days, and thence to Yunnan-Sen in seven days.

come in from Montgze and Manhao, without passing
through Laokay, and they bring opium, which they
sell for a quarter the price it costs in the Delta, as
the monopoly does not extend beyond Cho-Bo.


There are a great many mines in the country, and
the goldfields, one or more of which we hope to visit,
are celebrated, though at present they yield little, as,
since the war and the incursion of the Black Flags
the Chinese workmen have left the country, and have
not yet returned, while the native races do but little
in the way of mining.


As regards population, the country may be divided
into three zones, limited according to the altitude :
below being the Thais; half wTay up the hills the
Mans, and at the summit the Meos,—each of these
three races having the most profound contempt for
the other.


Brothers of the people of the Laos and of Siam,
the Thais (free men, or labourers of the mountain,
Pou-Thai) are to be traced under the names of Thou,
Thou-jen, Pan, Pai, Shan, Lao, &c, disseminated
over a vast extent of territory, the approximate limits
of wrhich would be Setchouen to the north, the
Quantoung to the east, the Irrawaddy to the west,
and Cambodia and the Gulf of Siam to the south.
Coining- originally, no doubt, from the north many
centuries ago as invaders, and representing the debris
of some ancient empire, they have more than one
point in common with the Thibet races and with
the tribes which people the banks of the Upper
Mekong above the Yunnam. They have an alphabet
of their own, and, like the Thibetans, they write from
left to right, while I find many points of resemblance

chiefly of blue stars. There is little variety of
headdress; it always consists of a blue or white turban with
lappets falling on each side of the head and framing
it; but as a rule we only see the women's back, for as
soon as they perceive us, even from a distance, they
turn round so as to hide their faces, and often pretend
to pick up wood on the road, but they appear less
timid in the houses. Thou endeavours to make
friends with them, and with the lituong Cam Koui, who
still accompanies us, he acts as interpreter, acquitting
himself very well in this new profession. He tells us
that there are some sick peojile in the village where
we are sleeping, but " their recovery appears to be
certain; for some pieces of linen and of hempen
thread have been suspended iu front of their houses,
some music will be played, and the spirits which now
torment them will certainly be appeased."  
  
  
  March \5th.


In the hills above the valley of the Nam Lai. There
is very little water until the evening, and consequently
very few villages, except a few Meos houses. A small
pass has to be crossed, from which there is a superb
view, for at our feet lie the Nam Lai and the fields which
it irrigates; further on we perceive the great gap in the
hills produced by the confluent of the rivers, which
meet at the foot ofthe promontory of Laichau, and in the
distance the woods extend as far as we can see, covering
the rounded brows of the mountains, passing from
light to dark green, from glaucous to bluish tints, and
finally disappearing in the mists of the horizon. AVe

pretext of protecting and helping us, they are really,
I believe, nothing but spies. But we pay very little
attention to them.


As far up as to Paklay navigation is easy enough.
The stream of an average width of 330 to 650 feet, is
bordered by woods, or low hills. The water is
shallow and discovers little islands or big sand-banks.


Rapids are numerous, and several, such as Keng
Sanai or Keng Luong, are dangerous. The black schist
rocks, some of them seventeen feet high, and strewn
confusedly in every direction, form a serious
obstruction, and between them, in the narrow passages, the
water descends in a smooth firm current, which glides
with a dizzy swiftness, or rises into high waves. At
other times it breaks against a wall of rock, suddenly
changes its direction, and forms with the main
current whirlpools like funnels. The passage of a  
  
  
  small canoe through this hubbub of waters must be

frightful. AVith our rafts, our men, who are very
expert, manage marvellously, but they are often
forced to bale out the water.


The rapids have no special name " We call them,"
say our boatmen, " what we have heard our fathers
call them. The rapids were made by God with the
world, like the mountains and the rivers."


Happy they who do not tire themselves out in the
search for first causes !


Some of the rocks have a story of their own. In
the afternoon of the 20th we leave on our left a chalk
cliff, which descends precipitously from a height of
some 650 feet into the stream. On the sides of the
mountain the trees manage to cling somehow or
other, and numerous fissures, forming here and there

light a lamp and start iu search of an animal, that
has taken flight, to judge from their movements,
though I do not see it. They afterwards explain
their manœuvres; one of them had seen a long
myriapod, which they were anxious to destroy, as it is a
dangerous insect. They say, that when it crawls
over the skin it leaves traces of its passage, in
longred painful and unhealthy streaks. I do not know
whether this assertion is true, but at all events, they
seem much afraid of the insect.  
  
  
  March 27th.


Before the start, our men fasten fresh bamboos to
the sides of the pirogues, and place a thick row of
palm trees round the bows, forming a small hedge.
The effect is original, for we seem to carry a garden
in front of us. In spite of these precautions, we ship
several waves at the first rapid; it is considered
dangerous, and we are not sorry to find ourselves on
the other side, for the impression is very different
when descending the river instead of ascending it;
everything depends uj^on the steersman placed at the
bows. The man must be very skilful, for he has to
guide the pirogue, which moves with great rapidity,
exactly between two rocks, one surplus touch of the
oar would inevitably sink it.


Once out of danger the boatmen replace the
waterpipe used on the Black River by the cigarette, which
they put behind the ear after a few whiffs. They
also chew betel. I remark that the majority of them
wear a bracelet, made of two threads, on the right
wrist. They tell us that it is a talisman—a kind of

forms the principal ingredient of their meals. Two
earthenware pots cemented one above the other serve
as a saucepan; the bottom of the upper one is pierced
with small holes, the water is placed in the lower one,
and the steam as it escapes through the holes, cooks
the rice. The men find a few seasonings in the
woods; acidulated pods (tamarisk ?) and banana buds,
which, they say, give an excellent flavour to fish.


Our boys themselves, although they have only
played the part of spectators, appear to require some
rest after the emotions of the clay. Thou becomes
communicative; he confesses to me that he has gained
a great deal at Van Bou, but he will not play any
more; and, in order to avoid temptation, he asks me to
change the twenty piastres which he possesses for a
note. I do not believe in his " drunkard's oath; " his
favourite game is played with four sapeques. The
players bet upon heads or tails; here it is black or white.
\"The Congais," admitted Thou, "are fond of gambling,
and hold the winners in great esteem."


I take advantage of the young Annamite's
confidential mood to ask him about his creed. " Yen a," he
tells me, " Thou dead will become a small leaf at the
top of a tree." And he looks with a melancholy
expression at the foliage, which trembles in the wind.
But this subject of conversation does not please him;
he prefers talking about Luang Prabang and lovely
women.  
  
  
  February 25th.


Always the same slow ascent, but it is not wearisome
to those who will look about them. There are notes
to enter, birds to prepare, photographs to take,

behind him. The latter, attired in a short blue tunic,
with a langouti of rose-coloured silk, wears shoes and
stockings and has his hair cut very short. Although
of intelligent bearing, he seems embarrassed by the
presence of the colonel, to whom he turns every time
he speaks, as much as to ask his leave to open his
mouth. In fact, I do not think that I should be
doing him an injustice if I said that he gave me the
impression of a pupil with his tutor.


Having taken our seats in a circle round a table,
upon which stood gold cups containing cigarettes, we
have leisure to notice that the room is draped with
bamboo mats and lighted by petroleum lamps, while
in the recess is a throne in blue and red, shaped very
much like a bed and surmounted by a white dais
trimmed with lace. From the wall behind hangs a
portrait of his father done at Bangkok.


Upon a sign from the king, tea and cigarettes are
brought us, and the servants fan us. The other
servants, who are dressed like the common people,
remain in a crouching attitude, and if they move
about the room do so on their hands and knees. It
is humiliating to see men dragging themselves about
like animals; but we do not witness the sight long
as our visit is a brief one, and it is not until some
time after this that we see the father, a fine old
man of eighty-two, whose white hair is cropped
close, and whose face is very intelligent, though
owino- to the loss of his teeth the chin is rather

elevated.


His position as a semi-divinity enables him to
speak his mind very freely, and he takes great
interest in our journey, giving us some advice as to  
  
  
  z
<!-- Leaf 108, Page: 92 -->
for exploiting these forests, and the Annamites, cut
off in this way from their former means of livelihood,
are apt to develop into pirates.


Other grievances are the difficulties placed in the
way of meeting all applications for concessions, and I
have already given an instance of this in regard to the
mines at Hong-Hay. Then there is the long string
of formalities, red tape documents, and impediments
of every kind which are thrown in the way of any
enterprise which is likely to succeed. One would really
imagine, looking at the mere facts of the case, that it is
the desire of the Government to prevent as far as it
can any personal initiative either of those in its service
or of the colonist, and this without having put a stop
to the abuse of influence on the part of the former.


Then, again, there is the question of favouritism.
A friend in the colony who has only too good reason
to know what he is talking about, writes to me :
"You are well aware of the contracts which M. de
Lanessan has concluded privately; after
havingpromised all the contractors to let each of them
have his share in the series of important works which
had to be carried out, he conciliated the larger ones
by assigning them the Hanoi hospitals, the Langson
railway, and the barracks at Dop-Cau. When the turn
of the small men came, he made some sort of excuse
for putting out the rest of the work to be tendered
for, allowing those who had already secured work to
take their chance. The result was that they got all,
and the little men nothing. We have never seen
a grosser case of favouritism out here."


Small outlays, when accumulated and when they
do not lead to anything durable, are more costly than
<!-- Leaf 55, Page: 39 -->
which come to bury their eggs in them and take care
not to return by the same way, in order that their
hiding-place may not be discovered. All this makes
me feel very much inclined to remain here longer, but
time presses, and I am obliged to devote what
remains to an inspection of the coal-fields.


The Hatou coal is extracted from the surface, like
stone from a quarry, the thickness of the scams—one
about 220 feet, the other about 35—and their
contiguity to the surface rendering this possible.
Two sides of the hill have been opened up in this
way and look from a distance like gigantic staircases.
In short, the work consists in reversing the mountain,
and the danger of fire, which would arise from the
great strain placed upon the lower shafts, is entirely
done away with. Moreover, the thickest of the two
seams is intersected by beds of schist, and whereas it
would be difficult in a mine to avoid these, the
system adopted makes it easy to dig above or below
them. Moreover, the coal can be removed as soon as
it has been extracted, and the despatch of the trucks
and communication with the central railway have been
facilitated by means of inclined planes, tunnels in the
rock (one of which is 520 feet long), and
embankments. Several thousand tons have already been
extracted, and it is calculated that in a near future
the output will be 300 tons a day.


Before returning to Hong-Hay we make the ascent
to the small military post which has recently been
established here, from which there is a splendid view,
and in the distance we see the ruins of the few huts
composing the village of Hatou, which the pirates had
burnt a month previously.
<!-- Leaf 194, Page: 178 -->
eddying at the bottom of the basin of Molou. The
baskets filled, the earth is carried a short distance to
a box of planks about a yard square, set in the ground;
the bottom forms a gentle slope and a thin thread of
water passing over the upper edge flows beneath the
partition at the bottom; with a toothless rake a
workman continually pushes back the earth that the water
carries down; gradually, first the large stones, then the
coarser gravel, are separated from the fine sand and
are carried away; then the rake is laid down, and the
earth that remains upon the uneven plank is gently
spread out; the heavier nuggets are caught, picked up
by the nail and placed upon a piece of banana leaf.
Whatever the natives may say, a great deal must be
lost by this system, and they are not acquainted with
the use of mercury. They tell me that they have
tried the sifters we have seen used in Thibet without
finding any more gold than they do now; but, from
the thirty-two baskets full of clay that we saw
washed at Molou, only fifty-two centigrammes of
gold were obtained, that is, scarcely twenty-three
grains troy to the ton.


The extraction of gold is now made for the benefit
of two half-castes, Thais and Chinese. The Chinese
here no longer work at the mines; they cultivate the
fields and occupy themselves with trade. The labourers
employed are not paid but fed; they form, in a way,
part of their master's family. Their support (food
and opium) may be valued at the outside at
fourpence halfpenny a day. As the gold is found it is
exchanged with the Chinese for various merchandise,
opium first of all. The raw drug comes from
Mougtze" by Laichau. In the former city it is worth

  CHAPTER I

Arrival at Hong-Kong—A Visit to Canton—Its Trade—The

Chinese Town—-The JSateaitx d Fleurs—Return to
Hong
Kong—Experiments with Tonkin Coal.

The Sidney has just cast anchor in the port of
Hong-Kong, and facing us, enveloped in a mantle of
mist which seems as if it had been imported from
England, the tall houses rise one above the other
upon the hillside, which is scored as with a broad
streak by the line of the funicular railway.


Our steamer is at once swooped upon by a
multitude of coolies, who have hoisted themselves up, one
after the other, over the sides of the ship. Long
bamboo canes with grappling-hooks attached to the
ends serve them as scalingdadders. These coolies
give one the impression of being the material out of
which pirates could be made with very little trouble,
and they remind one not a little of the ladrones. In
the swell caused by the blowing off steam, the junks
come into collision with one another, despite the
efforts of the women in charge of them; and these
women, whose movements do not appear to be in the

strongly to be recommended to all travellers in this
district, for they do not take up much room, they do
not effect much damage in large rivers, and they
procure at a reasonable price food which is much
appreciated by the coolies.


We encounter several rapids to-day, one of which
is named the Cho-Bo bar, with a very narrow canal
and a swift current, something like eighty feet in
fourteen seconds; and while we are being hauled up I
teach Thou how to catch the butterflies, which are
very numerous about here, having first made a net
out of the muslin used for mosquito curtains and a
little wire.


Our boatmen watch us with astonishment, for they
are more practical, and only collect what is good to
eat, such, for instance, as the leaves of a small shrub
called Moleun, which they pound and cook like
spinach, or a green plant which, after having been
boiled and strongly flavoured with pimento, is eaten
with rice.


They are a very good sort of people these natives
of Lai, for I notice that they are often laughing, and
that they never quarrel, sitting round the fire and
singing with a nasal twang, or playing soft tunes with
an instrument made of reeds and fitted into a
cocoanut shell. Some of them are fishing and laying down
lines for the night, and they are adepts at casting to
a great distance their hook by means of a bamboo
with a large ring at the end of it.


Although they are always later to bed than we are
they are up before us, and the only halt they make
during the day is for an hour at breakfast time, and I
ask myself how they contrive to do with so little
<!-- Leaf 131, Page: 115 -->
consisting of a palisade with very pointed tips,
behind which is a ditch, across this latter being laid
bamboos pointed outwards, and serving for loopholes.
All round are spiked railings, made of hard pointed
bamboos, while in the centre is a mirador (covered
balcony) raised upon four posts and provided with
a ladder.


We make but a short halt here, as it is late, and
during the last part of the journey I amuse myself,
by watching little Yao, who, though he has been
more than twelve miles, is still inclined to run ou
ahead, with the bell tied to his pigtail jingling.
When he has got a little way in advance he will sit
clown and take a piece of hollow- bamboo, and put
some tobacco into it, as the Chinese do, inhaling the
smoke as he trots along, and puffing it out very
gradually.


Nor is this the only interesting spectacle which
we have to divert us, for, to those who have their
eyes about them there is no such thing as a dull
stage in a journey through a new country, and
among new people. One of the mandarins, with
a bell-shaped straw hat, thinks that he is in the
height of fashion because he is wearing a
bathtowel as a mantle, while behind him comes a
rodbearer reminding one of the lictors of ancient
Rome, the quiver which he has slung round his
shoulder containing the wands, which are an emblem
of command, and the small flags which are used to
transmit orders.


Upon reaching Caophong, our halting place, we
are conducted to the house of the chief, who is to
put us up, and the interior is very clean. We are  
  
  
  1 2
<!-- Leaf 331, Page: 315 -->
which they have received; but upon the other hand
the}'' know their country well, are fairly familiar
with geography, possessing a good idea of distances,
and also having a good memory for historical
occurrences, while their annals are in good order and
are well kept.


In short, I have only to repeat what I said
above; that they are a curious people; lazy without
being fools; of equal fortune, as a rule, without
great wealth or great distress; of a fairly pacific
character; w-eU disposed towards foreigners without
exhibiting the intolerable curiosity of the Chinese;
very religious, more, perhaps, from habit than from
strong convictions; and, what is so rare in the East,
treating women and girls w-ith deference. For,
while very free in their morals, they have their
serenades and their " Courts of Love," reviving in the
midst of Indo-China practices which belong rather to
the Europe of the Middle Ages. There is something
poetical, chivalrous and French, or, to go back to an
earlier period, something Athenian in the inhabitants
of the Laos; and if they have not the artistic feeling
of the Greek, they have no desire for a knowledge of
luxury. Having very little to earn, they do not
work much and their existence is more unfettered.
From a material point of view a Laotian is happier
than the French workman, whose grinding toil
contributes to the unlimited enjoyment of the few,
and whose individuality is swallowed up in the
mechanism of some vast industrial enterprise.


AVith regard to the future of the Laotian race, it may
be foretold with certainty that it is fated to have the
same lot which it has itself meted out to the less
<!-- Leaf 373, Page: 357 -->
very well wooded, too, and I have been able to bring
back some forty specimens of wood, chief among
which I may mention the teak, called the mal sok,
which grows in large quantities on the banks of the
Mekong, a few clays above Luang Prabang, near
Kiangsen, and below the city, near Paklay.


The mode of concession for the forests in Siam
must lead to a complete disappearance of the best
timber, the holder of the concession being at liberty
to cut down as much as he pleases. The result will
be that the timber required for the navy will have to
be purchased in Burmah, where the English have
the sense to prevent waste, or on the Mekong. At
the present time two vegetable products are exported
from Luang Prabang, one being cardamome and the
other benzoin, the latter having recently decreased 50
per cent, in value on the Bangkok market, doubtless
because this perfume is now extracted from hippuric
acid and other matters by chemical processes, while
in time the flora of the country, which is very rich
in other wild plants highly perfumed, will doubtless
lend itself to fresh sources of industry.


In addition to the native products it will be easy
to introduce fresh cultivations, such as the pepper
tree, which already thrives in Annam, the vine, which
grows wild on the plateau of the Potion, and fruit
trees of various kinds. There is a great deal of
mineral wealth, too, in the Laos country, and among
the many gold fields which might be worked to
advantage are Pae Bay (above Luang Prabang), Xieng
Mang, aud Xieng Mon. There is an abundance of
antimony, lead, copper, and iron, while there arc
agates and chalcedonies near Luang Prabang. Then,
<!-- Leaf 429 -->
  
  The Canton and Pakoi Routes through Paisec 41 3

which would naturally pass that way, we have no
reason to fear them provided we act instead of sleeping
on our laurels.  
  
  
  Let us turn now to the East.


A great route much frequented by the Chinese,
and in particular by the people of Canton, feeds in
this direction Quang-Si and Yunnam. It is the
route which from Yunnam-Sen or Muugtze goes to
Paisee and Nanning, and thence southwards to Pakoi,
or eastwards by Si-Kiang to Canton. From Canton
to Paisee by water is a matter of thirty-five days,
including loading and unloading, and from Paisee to
Yunnam-Sen by land twenty-three days, making a
total of fifty-eight days. From Pakoi to Lu-AVuslm
is five days by water; thence to Nan-Shing is three
days by road; from Nan-Shing to Paisee, by way of
Naming, is twenty clays by water, in all fifty-one
days. This plain statement of distances is enough to
show7 that the eastern cannot compete with the Tonkin
route for the Yunnam trade, and can barely provide
goods for a part of Kouang-Si. Lung-Cheou on our
frontier is only six to nine clays from Nanning. Now
Bourne in his report, which no one will be inclined
to think partial towards us, says that the larger
part of the commerce of Kouang-Si must pass
through Pakoi. "But," he adds, "if a railway were
constructed to Tonkin, going to the eastern frontier
nearly as far as Lang-Cheou, this state of things would
be altered." The English Consul thinks that the
Viceroy of Canton will not be so ill-advised as to let
us make a railway before he himself has made one
from Pakoi to Nanning.  
  
  
  The forecasts of Mr. Bourne have not been realized
<!-- Leaf 430, Page: 414 -->
The railway from Langson is about to be completed,
the line will be transformed from a gauge of two
feet to one of forty inches, an alteration which at the
start might have been avoided, but which will provide
the administration with Decauville stock capable of
being used elsewhere. I need not repeat my former
criticism of the construction of this line, nor even
ask if it would have been more practicable to have
constructed another line at first. It is enough for
the moment to know that the Langson railway will
be pushed on up to the frontier near to
LangCheou. Now, to my knowledge, the Viceroy of
Canton has constructed no line above Pakoi. In a
very near future the commerce of Nanning, and
therefore of half of the Kouang-Si is destined to fall
into our hands.1


Already the trade between Lang-Cheou and Tonkin
is valued by our Consul at about 300,000 taels, nearly
£80,000. The town is destined to become the great
frontier depot of Kouang-Si.


From the above considerations thus briefly stated
these conclusions appear to me to follow:—


The great commercial future of Tonkin lies
not so much to the right in Kouang-Si, or to the left
in Laos, as above it in Yunnam.


Across this province our commerce must develop
in three directions: westwards toivards the rich
districts of Ibang, Stemao, and Puerh, and beyond
up to Tali-Fou, that is to Thibet; northward toivards


1 The freight charges per picul of merchandise,which at present
are four piastres from Pakoi to Nanning, will be reduced to one
and a half from Haiphong to Lang-Cheou, when the railway is
completed.
<!-- Leaf 206, Page: 190 -->

The harsh cries of the peacocks are heard as they
answer each other from hill to hill, but they cannot
be seen. Some native hunters have been more
fortunate than ourselves, for we pass a pirogue with
the skin of a young tiger, killed a few days ago,
drying upon it.


To-day, as always, there are a great many rapids,
but some of them are more dangerous than usual.
One of them, Hat-Meo, is divided in twTo by a bank
of shingles; we are puzzled how to approach it.
After some discussion, the boatmen all get into the
water intending to drag the pirogue round to the left,
but the current is too strong and withstands their
efforts it seizes the boat and carries it off; the men
have only time to jump on board. We redescend the
stream with great rapidity while the steersman vainly
attempts to guide our course; there is nothing to be
done, and I foresee the moment when we shall be
dashed with tremendous force against a large rock;
there is not a yard between us; the boat will
break or at least fill with water. Take care!

{empty}. A light shock, just sufficient to wake our
lazy interpreter with a start, and that is all. With
wonderful skill, one of the boatmen has managed
to spring upon the rock, before the pirogue touches
it, and supporting his back against the stone, he has
broken the shock with his feet. A cord or rather
two are at once unrolled, and every one sets to work
and pulls. It is well that we have two cables, for one
breaks instantly, but at last, after many efforts, we
pass through this formidable rapid. We have advanced
about eighty yards in an hour and a half.  
  
  
  Our men do not forage for their dinner; rice always
<!-- Leaf 138, Page: 122 -->
which M. Vacle has induced his nephew to pay to
Cho-Bo is regarded as a great success.


During dinner the old gentleman is quite ready to
answer our questions, and I take advantage of this
to interrogate him as to the mode of burying the
dead which prevails in his territory. He tells us
that the bodies are placed in wooden coffins with a
layer of ashes under the body, and wadding over it,
the whole being carefully closed clown. Then, instead
of placing it in the earth, they keep it in their houses
for months, or even years, and one quamlong whom I
visit has had his mother's body in his room for
twenty-two months. Sometimes this is done in
order to select a propitious moment for burial; in
other cases, it is because the family is poor, and is
saving up enough money to celebrate becoming
funeral rites. As long as the body is in the house
the relatives are expected to be in mourning, which is
not confined to a change of raiment but extends to
abstention from chewing betel nut, or listening- to
singing women, in addition to which they do not sit
on red mats, wear handsome robes, smoke, or shave
the head. Such are the principal rules observed by
the relatives of defunct persons.


While conversation is going on upon this not very
cheerful topic, M. Vacle calls my attention to the
curious shape of the piece of furniture on which we are
taking our meal. It is a large coffer of yellow wood
placed lengthways in a hollow made in the centre of the
raised platform, and upon examining it more closely
we see that it is neither more nor less than a coffin.
The discovery is not a very appetizing one, but the
natives reassure us, and say that the coffin is empty
<!-- Leaf 287, Page: 271 -->
  
  March 29th.


The river narrows and forms a rapid, which is
considered dangerous; and before he approaches it our
steersman takes off his turban and rolls it round his
breast, then he wTashes his face, kneels clown like a
Mussulman with clasped hands, then, raising himself,
he strikes the pirogue several times with his hand; he
is invoking the devil, who guards the rapids, and is
begging him to grant us a safe passage. This prayer
is a Laotian custom; for my own part the ceremonial
inspires me with less confidence than our men's quick
eyes and strong arms, which take us through the
rapids without any check.


AVe stop for lunch at the village of Ban Sop Huan,
on the right bank of the river; the houses form a
street, like the one at Sop Nao; as usual two posts
stand at the entrance of it; each has a piece of carved
wood on the top, which, from a distance, resembles a
cluck or a chicken, some white scarves also are
hanging from them; they are intended to drive away the
evil spirits.


Under the houses the women are busy in various
employments, and the young girls are separating"
the cotton from its grain. They use an ingenious
machine for this purpose : a tray is placed upon a
support about the level of the waist; above it, two
rollers, one of iron and one of wood, turn in contrary
directions, as the cotton passes between them it is
freed from its impurities, which drop on one side,
while the textile fabric falls on the other. One of the
rollers is moved with one hand by a simple crank
while the other is worked by the foot and a pedal

understand primitive and simple people, divining
the forces of nature, making it sacred, even
worshipping it. I have seen it used for building, for defence,
for clothing; the young shoots are an excellent
nourishment; the sap perfumes the food; with the
wood you can make saucepans, pipes, pails, canals,
in fact all sorts of things ! The bark transforms
itself into paper; in piercing the knobs of certain
varieties the natives find water; in short, with
nothing- but bamboo they produce fire, by
strikingdry stalks one against the other. One admires the
startling inventions of modern science; exhibitions
are opened to show the results obtained by vapour
and electricity; but a place ought to be reserved
for bamboo productions, and it would need be a large
one.


During the rest of the day we press through
jungles of tall reeds which seem to have
warehoused an excess of heat; fires lighted amidst the
dry herbs spread with rapidity, and at the same
time the dull grumbling of the furious torrent; the
flames lick our horses' feet; with the sun above and
the fire below we are roasted both sides; and so
we come upon much, and this time one meets the
forests and their freshness at the same time with
all the more pleasure.


Towards evening, we reach the edge of the plateau
above the valley of S-ang-Bo; the view is splendid,
the spectacle grand, the Black River unrolls itself at
our feet, broad and tranquil, between high wooded
hills; we overlook the valley, and can fancy we are
close down upon the shore; it seems as thouo-h we
had barely a hundred metres descent to reach it, the

last application and the publication of this project of
the commission an important event had occurred.
After the investigations made by M. Fuchs in 1881,
{empty}M. Bavier-Chauffour, the representative of a group
of French capitalists, came with two friends, one of
whom was an engineer, and prepared the first
complete map of the coal-producing regions of the
Hong-Hay and Kebao. This work was executed
amid perils of every description, clue mainly to the
refusal of permission for him to arm an escort at
his own expense. But if he escaped the pirates, he
was not spared by the climate, and he was compelled
to go into the hospital at Haiphong. Having
recovered from his fatigues, he obtained in the same
year from the Court of Hue a concession of the
domains of Hong-Hay and Kebao, and the act, signed
on August 26, 1884, was legalised by the French
legation at Hue. It was not until after this that the
French Government instituted a Mining Commission,
for the purpose of drawing up a plan for regulating
the system upon which they were to be worked.
The Commission decided that all mines should be put
up to tender, and in the beginning of 1885, M.
Lemaire, the French Minister at Hue, having
intercepted and deciphered a telegram from M. Bavier to
the regents, sent them a note to the effect that
\"in the name of my Government the treaties between
{empty}M. Bavier-Chauffour and the Court of Hue are null
and void so far as regards the concession and
working of mines situated in the territories of
HongHay and Kebao. The French Government accepts
the full responsibility for this declaration with which
{empty}M. Bavier-Chauffour may be confronted in the
<!-- Leaf 367, Page: 351 -->
self-same dance which I saw when travelling through
Thibet with M. Bonvalot two years before. The
steps and the attitudes are exactly the same, and it
would be interesting to know whether this is a mere
chance or clue to the existence of the same traditions
between peoples living so far apart. The tam-tam,
which is beaten by hand, without any rhythm, is the
music used as an accompaniment, and from time to
time the monsters make a charge and send the crowd
flying, one of them chasing a young girl round a
tree. I can see only Laotians among the spectators,
the Kas holding aloof. AA7hen the dances are over,
the procession starts on its w-ay back, the priests
being escorted back to their several pagodas.


At nightfall, the town is still very animated, the
pagodas being the scenes of ceremonies known as
Ngones, which, to judge by the one I witnessed at
Ouate Mai, are very well worth a description. Ten
young girls were seated or rather were squatting upon
their heels against the wall, most of them having- a red
scarf passed over the right shoulder and under the
left arm. The only light was that afforded by two or
three earthenware saucers filled with oil in which a
wick was floating. A dish containing quids of
betelnut and a bamboo to serve as a spittoon were handed
round. Facing the girls were seated one or two
groups of young men playing upon the guitar, the
tam-tam and a sort of Laotian organ made of bamboo.
Several of them are singing, but when they do so
they put a corner of their scarf over their head so as
not to be seen, while others take up the chorus. AVhile
the singing is in progress, conversation is allowed to
go on between the young men and the girls, each of

sort of extract with which every traveller has to make
himself familiar. For my own part, I am convinced
that were I suddenly to be carried with my eyes
blindfolded to the bazaars of Aden, Colombo, or Canton,
I should know where I was by the smell. It is,
perhaps, the same with us, and the Chinese who come in
contact with us and style us " devils, sons of harlots
and pigs," to say nothing of other amenities which
the Sinophilists so readily excuse, are of opinion that
we stink. Be this as it may, Canton reeks with evil
odours, and it has more than this in common with
other Chinese towns, the streets being so narrow that
in many parts it is impossible to walk two abreast.
One can see that the population, which is estimated at
about a million, is far too closely packed, as is the case
in all the other great centres of China.


As in all the East, and as was the case with us in
the Middle Ages, each trade or business has its
separate street or quarter, and the butchers' quarter
would astonish those of our compatriots who are not
versed in Chinese tastes and customs, though it is not
very appetising to look at the dogs, the cats, the
ducks split open down the middle, and the
sucklingpigs chopped in halves. My own taste takes me
rather to the shops of the antiquaries, or the curios
as they are styled in the hideous patois spoken on
the coast of China, but there is little chance of a " find "
there, as too many Europeans have been on the
lookout for rarities. It takes weeks and even months to
hunt up and purchase an article of real interest and
value, so I have to content myself with a stroll through
the streets and an inspection of the shops, from which
however, much may be learned by any one who can

can be seen to the best advantage at night. AVe are
anxious to lift a corner of the veil which masks the
pleasures of the Chinese, as in order to form a proper
estimate of a people, it is necessary to see them at
play as well as at work. I feel, however, that there is
something like presumption in attempting to delineate
these little Chinese women, with their white faces and
darkened eyes, after they have been seen through the
coloured glasses of the imaginative Pierre Loti. One
who has, like myself, attempted to reproduce the
simple but impressive call of the nomad at sunset to
his horses as they feed on the steppe, or to depict the
grandeur of the snows of Thibet, can scarcely hope to
depict the charms of the bateaux cl fleurs of the
Chinese. It is difficult, in these circumstances, to
avoid indulging in psychology and dissecting like a
naturalist the spectacle which is before one.


Going from boat to boat, we find it no easy matter
to keep our balance as we step from one to another,
watching the gilded youth of Canton at its pleasures.
These boats are all much of the same kind, so a
description of one will do for the whole. The saloon
is spacious, with a profusion of wood-carving and
gilding, while embroidered silk hangings are arranged
to right and left like the decorations in a theatre.
There are large screens with birds or landscape scenes
done in pencil; sentences or golden letters, taken
from the principal philosophers, hang on the walls;
while from the ceiling hangs a European lamp with
blue glasses, which sheds its light upon small tables
of veined Yunnan marble, around which the
younoChinamen are seated in easy-chairs of red wood,
covered with bits of tapestry on which the phœnix is

the case when one gets into the upper districts wdiere
Annamite is not spoken, and we may esteem ourselves
fortunate if we succeed in getting hold of a native who
understands French and the Muong dialects. Several
friends had been kind enough, with the permission of
the Government, to secure for me one of the Cambodian
translators of the Pavie Mission, but by a singular
piece of ill-luck, Camboun, as he was called, had
crossed us at Haiphong without knowing we were
there and had started for home. In my opinion, this
mishap was not quite so accidental as it seemed, and
I believe that if one had been able to go back to " first
causes," it would have been found that there was a
woman at the bottom of it. However, there is no
help for it, and we must trust to our luck.


The date is January 22nd (1892), and M.
Chavassieux, the French resident, who is himself
going as far as Cho-Bo, offers to take us with him on
the steamer of that name. This vessel, which has two
paddles in the stern and belongs to the Messageries
Fluviales, has recently gone up the Red River as far
as Lao-Kay. After halting for the night near Viebsi,
we reach, in the course of the following mornino- the
confluent of the Black River, the line of demarcation
being made very distinct by the colours of the water,
and we are told that soles, for instance, will not go
beyond it, while skate, on the other hand, will go up
the river to within a short distance of Cho-Bo. To
the right may be seen the white houses of Honghoa,
half hidden in verdure, and beyond them the hills at
the foot of which they are built.


We are still in the Delta, or at all events in a flat
country, but just beyond this the ground begins to
<!-- Leaf 103, Page: 87 -->
distinct orders are sent to the persons inculpated, the
first, which is published in all directions, advising
them to render us justice, while the second, which is
secret and the only one valid, bids them continue in
the same course. I have had many proofs of this
mode of conduct, and it is, moreover, well known to
all travellers and missionaries who have been in direct
communication with the Chinese and have paid close
attention to them.


Put, admitting even that Pekin is powerless to
repress disorders occurring in its provinces which do
us damage, are we not justified in rejjlying : an eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth ? the lex talionis being
the only one which barbarians can be made to
understand.


The motto adopted for our foreign policy is to avoid
all unpleasantness. As long as this axiom is imposed
as a rule of conduct upon our agents in the East, we
shall lose each day a shred the more of our prestige,
until it has quite vanished, nor is that day far distant.
When it comes, we must not be surprised at anything
which happens to us, for the mischief done will be
immense and the remedy difficult and costly.


Before we are reduced to take extreme measures, it
is desirable that the whole truth should be known,
after which we may look about for the best means of
warding off the danger, the primordial conditions for
the suppression of piracy being sincerity and a spirit
of coherency at home and energy abroad. I have
already mentioned two causes which retard the
development of the colony; piracy and the system of
administration, the former being sometimes due to the
latter.
<!-- Leaf 432, Page: 416 -->
convincing testimony, however, is to be had in the
foreign books which can scarcely be regarded a&
partial towards us, and in the efforts of the English
to divert off from Tonkin to their own profit a trade
which they would not covet if they thought it of so
little importance.


Far be it from me to suppose that Tonkin itself, its
mines, its rice-fields, and its 12,000,000 consumers
should be neglected, in order to consider merely the
problem of how to penetrate into China. But the
development of Tonkin is in no way incompatible
with the desire to develop a more distant commerce.


Assuredly I agree with Colquhoun that the regions
of Puerh and Stemao are now- richer than those of
Yunnam, whence the Song-Coi issues before reaching
7 o o
our territory. Nevertheless, it is on our southern
frontier that are found the beds of copper and tin. The
plains of Mungtze, Tunghay, and the shores of lake
Yunnam-Sen, which I crossed, are open for a
cultivation of a most remunerative kind.


The regions which Colquhoun regards as richer
than those bordering the Upper Song-Coi ought, as
I have tried to show, to form part of our zone of
commercial influence.


AVith out repeating- the arguments already developed,
are not the figures themselves the most eloquent
reply to the fears of M. de Lanessan ?


The traffic of the Red River develops from year to
year. The trade of Hong Kong amounted to—

embroidered. Upon the benches on each side recline
the opium smokers, left, like so many inert masses, to
their pipe and their lamp. Those who are not
smoking axe playing cards with small ivory counters
which they hold in fan shape, or at dominos, which
they strike together with as much noise as possible,
while others are content to take some tea and
sweetmeats. These are served them by young women,
whose faces, with rouge upon the lower lip, and black
hair, profusely oiled and ornamented with flowers,
or else drawn back upon each side of the head like
rams' horns, clearly indicates their calling. But
despite their jade earrings, they are not all women of
the first class, for I notice that some of them have
large feet.


Contrary to the habit of their compatriots, which
is to regard foreigners as intruders, two fat Chinamen
who have come perhaps from Hong-Kong, ask us to
have some tea. We exchange cigars, and a
conversation—by gestures—is started, which does not seem
to please the ladies, as they are afraid, if seen in the
company of Europeans, of losing caste. But they are
soon made to hold their tongues by our new friends,
who have evidently taken a fancy to us, as they get
permission for us to stay and hear the concert. The
music is rhythmical and monotonous, but less
discordant than usual, the orchestra consisting of a
'tamiscen (Japanese guitar), the chords of which are
stretched upon the skin of a serpent, a violin shaped
like a thick hammer, a gong, and a sort of drum
upon which a woman strums alternately with two
wands.  
  
  
  A quarter of an hour of this harmony is about as
<!-- Leaf 437, Page: 421 -->

\"The result of this organization " (of the Yangtze)
adds M. Rocher, " and the abundance of means of
transport make the freight from Ichang to
ChungKing much cheaper than from Hanoi to Lao-kai.
And yet the navigation of the Upper Yangtze is far
more difficult than that of the Red River.


The possession of the best land does not suffice to
make a man rich, he must know also how to render it
productive. Yet if one takes a backward glance, the
Red River is seen to be to-day what it ivas three years
ago; nothing has been done; the difficulties are the
same. There is no development either of the river
service or of the aids to transport, and whatever
security there is has been bought at a very dear price.
The roving frontier bands exact what they call " a
tax against piracy."


{empty}2. Mistakes of Individuals.—AVhen one marks the
slight efforts of the Government to encourage and
develop the Red River trade, to render the stream
practicable and navigable, or even to study the best
route for a railway, one cannot be surprised to find
private initiative, thus left so entirely to its own
resources, quite behindhand. And yet it is to
private initiative alone that are due the few practical
attempts to penetrate into Yunnam. The Messageries
Fluviales have carried their steamers up to Lao-kai.


It is not that our colonists lack daring and energy.
No; the only reproach to be laid at their door, and
the defects which throws them so far behind the
English and the Germans, is that they do not gather
minute and accurate enough information through
competent agents as to what should be done.
<!-- Leaf 110, Page: 94 -->
placing the money in the coffers of the French deposit
bank, the administration converted it into francs
(about 19,000). When, about two and a half years
later, the depositor applied for the return of his
caution money, the piastre having in the meanwhile
dropped in value, he was told that he had only 4,500
piastres to his credit. The Chinaman protested, and
though he was told that he had better sue the
administration for it, he had not the means to prosecute his
suit and was compelled to put up with the first loss.  
  
  
  the wretched condition of the troops.


I need, not repeat here what the conditions of
existence for our soldiers have been since the
occupation, and I will leave others to describe the defective
sanitary conditions, as regards lodging, food and
clothing to which they have constantly been
subjected; it will be seen what waste there has been in
the victualling department, and how little has been
done to ameliorate the material existence of men and
officers alike, while, in striking contrast to the small
outlay upon the troops, may be placed the useless
expense incurred in the moving about of so many
officials from post to post. The public will theii see
what are the true reasons which have given Tonkin
so bad a reputation, from the point of view of climate.
I remember a post where we halted during the journey
I made in 1889, upon the right bank of the Red
River. It had been arranged that the soldiers, who
had at first been encamped in the middle of marshes,
in the bottom of a fever-stricken hollow, should be
located upon an eminence more healthily situated, and
<!-- Leaf 175, Page: 159 -->
face, they must fight; if the struggle ends without
bloodshed it is considered a bad omen. Sometimes
they are both invited to the same ceremony; one then  
  
  
  remains outside while the other is in the house, and

vice versa.


The dead are usually burnt upon a funeral pile, the
place being afterwards marked by a small wooden
altar; the ashes are inclosed in a vase and buried in
some distant spot, which is reached by an indirect
footpath.


As we continue our journey amongst the Thais, we
shall constantly have occasion to allude to their
dwellings, their resources, and their manner of living.


With regard to the Mans I have seldom met them;
the localities they inhabit are often at some distance
from each other, and they are not numerous between
the Red and the Black Rivers. In type they approach
the Mais, and their costume, particularly that of the
women, clearly distinguishes them from the other
races. Are they of Thibetan origin, as some authorities
have said? The problem is not yet solved; but
they appear, like other races, to have come from the
table-lands of the north.


Perhaps the invasion of the Meos was more recent.
The Miao-tye, as they are called in Chinese, with
their brothers the Yaos and the Lolos, still occupy the
heights of Yunnan, Setchuen. and even of Quangsi
as far as Quantoung, which, according- to some
authors, is the cradle of their race. They are
mountaineers, tall, elegantly formed, with a firm
gait, easily recognized from a distance; their
faces are open, fair, and energetic; their character is
gay. Usually of a peaceful disposition, they have, in
<!-- Leaf 90, Page: 74 -->
advance in Indian file. With these new roads, the
pirates are deprived of a great part of their advantages,
the route, now completed, from Tien-Yen to Langson,
which traverses the eastern region of Tonkin, parallel
to the open frontier of China, being of great strategic
importance.


The system of 36-feet roads, upon which a tramway
might be laid at any given time, is unquestionably a
step forward, though far from being perfection.
Railways are preferable, and the English have set us
a very good example in this respect. Upper Burmah
was occupied by them in 1885, and in 188 7 there was
a railway to Mandalay, while despite the competition
of the easy navigation of the Irawaddy, it soon
brought in more profits than any one of the Indian
railways. In Tonkin only one railway1 has as yet
been decided upon, this being one to conn ect
PhulangTuong to Langson and the frontier of China, the
strategical and commercial importance of which will
be referred to hereafter. I do not wish to indulge in
personalities or discuss special methods of
construction, but as it is well that the public should know how
an enterprise, which is one of general interest, has
been entered upon and conducted, a few facts maybe
stated, the conclusions being left to the reader.


The construction was granted to M. Soupe, who in
turn entered into contracts to sublet a portion of the
work.'2 The Administration, which, by the terms ofthe
agreement, had reserved to itself the right of
purchasing direct its own plant, preferred to incur the heavy

lines.

<!-- Leaf 293, Page: 277 -->

The duration of time does not trouble them either,
they count the days like the Laotians, and their year
consists of twelve lunar months of four weeks each,
of which one contains eight days, at the end of a few
years a month is intercalated. Dates escape them
altogether. " The old people know them," they reply
to our questions.


I am trying to make a lexicon of their language;
they answer us, but sometimes we have a great deal
of trouble in hearing what they say, and particularly
in separating the affixes or suffixes, with which they
can surround the same word. I notice the absence
of special names for certain classes of things; they
have no word for bread, and the names of the
numerals, except the four first, are borrowed from the
Laotians; lastly mother is called ma, the word in
general use amongst nearly all the peoples of the
world, perhaps because it is the first sound that a
newborn infant instinctively produces, when it requires
food.


From their own account, they have no special songs,
but they use the Laotian music.


Writing is unknown to them; but they keep their
accounts, or send their messages by means of small
pieces of bamboo, marked with notches which are
made at closer or longer intervals according to the
signification that has been arranged. This is like our
bakers' sticks.1 Our men smoke a wooden pipe, with
a small bamboo stem, like those of our countries.


1 M. Harmand has found amongst the peoples of the south of
Indo-China the same method of correspondence that Father
C'rabouillet discovered amongst the Lolos of Setchoun. (Cf.
"Note on the Writing of the Indo-Chinese Khas," by M P.
Lefevre-Pontalis, L' Anthropologie, Mars-Avril, 1892.)

luck charm, which is given to them when they leave
their village to navigate or trade. In the morning
we travel through a woody country full of game, and
I kill a dog-faced monkey. Charles shoots a stag,
and we see a great many wild cocks. AVe find some
villages in the afternoon, and I get out at one of
them—Sop Kin. It contains about twenty huts—
small houses built upon piles like those of the Thais,
but more elegant, and half hidden amongst clumps
of flowering trees, orange groves, palms, cocoanut
palms, and bananas. The mulberry tree is also
cultivated for the purpose of rearing silkworms. The
women are not so shy here as in Upper Tonkin.
They bathe in the river without troubling themselves
about us. One young girl is coloured yellow with
saffron, and we are told that this is done from
coquetry. Most of them wear a small chignon, in which
they often place flowers. As a rule, the inhabitants
appear careless and idle; but probably they need not
work to obtain a living, for commerce is the usual
occupation in this district. I meet some merchants
selling salt that has come from Hong Hay by Luang
Prabang. The commodity is in small packets wrapped
in banana leaves. Its price is about one rupee for
six pounds. In return they export chiefly rice and silk.  
  
  
  March 28th.


AVe pass between high calcareous cliffs, which are
further apart than those of the Black River. In the
wall on one side there is the opening of a grotto
almost on the level of the river. The cliff is covered
with drawings all round it, but the interior is only

orchids. One feels one's self to be very petty beneath
these giants of the tropics, which seem to crush one
with their immense height, and we are very impatient
to reach the summit, after having sweated, blown, and
struggled for an hour or more. A climb of this kind
quite explains the power of the pirates, for what
chance has a column of a hundred men against ten
who know the country and can select their own
hiding-places 1 In order to be master of this district
the only method is that resorted to by M. Vacle,
namely, to have the chiefs on your side, and play
the one off against the other.


The table-land on to which we find our way
through a forest of reeds, which in many cases are
eighteen feet high, consists in part of vast, uncultivated
regions, with undulating ground covered with
halfburnt herbage, in part of rice fields, the latter being
mostly situated in the hollows formed by the chalk
cliffs which alternate with the round mounds of the
same formation. There are a few clumps of trees
upon the hills, while upon the slopes are several
long slits which remind one of the car of Denys of
Syracuse.


The bare and deserted region is the one we traverse
first, and as we proceed the road widens and gets
pretty good, little being required to make it available
for wheel traffic.


{empty}M. Vacle thinks that cattle might be bred here
with success, and I quite share his views, as there is
no lack of space and the pasturages appear to be
good.


A small native post has been established upon the
hill, the mode of defence, adapted to the country,
<!-- Leaf 403, Page: 387 -->
toll-station at Pae Nam. Now the tax collectors rang
three times to stop the Siamese boat. As the latter
continued on its way without taking any notice, the
toll-boat set out in pursuit, overtook it, and in
colliding upset it.


As for us, suddenly called on to become judges, we
have only to declare our complete incompetence, and to
wish "bon voyage" to the soldiers (whom, indeed, we
have never seen since), warning them, however, that
if they wrorry us again, it is from us that they will get
another bath.


At Pae Nam we fall in with two Europeans, a
Dane and an Englishman, who are leaving the Menam
to ascend its tributary the Meping (Menam Laheng,
as it is called by the boatmen) to traffic in teak. AVe
pass the evening together talking of the country we
have just passed through. The Dane, after having
remained for five years in the Siamese army as an
instructor and officer, disgusted at not being able to
make good soldiers out of his men, has given up his
post, and is now in the teak trade. The wood is sold
in bulk. A log or trunk of thirty-five to forty feet in
length and about three feet thick, is sold for forty
ticals. It is floated down at high water, the rafts on
the Meping being constructed at a spot about ten days
above Pae Nam. Teak is certain to disappear from
Siam in a near future, and it will then have to be
purchased, as we are told, on the Mekong, in the direction
of Paklay and Nam.


AVith reference to the Mekong, my interlocutor tells
me that he has passed through Luang Prabang on his
way to Cambodia. According to him there is very
little trade to be carried on upon the Upper Mekong,

whole establishment, which is under the direction of
Lieutenant Talboux.


While we halt, a messenger arrives bringing an
order from the colonel that every one is to descend
to Van Bou immediately. Twenty minutes at the
outside suffice for the mobilization, the huts are
pulled down, the bamboos utilized as supports
and as thongs; everything is packed. The
sharpshooters do not forget their rice, above all, their
opium lamps. Only a pig is left, that half lives
in the thicket, aud that until now has acted as
scavenger, a part that his conquerors have the habit of
playing under the Muong houses. We soon reach
the bottom, when we find that Colonel Pennequin
has just heard of the destruction of the outpost of
Yen Lang, which took place a week ago. Captain
Pouligou and several men are killed, forty-five guns
and twenty-five thousand cartridges are taken, and the
Doc Ngu is triumphant, so there is no time to lose.
A reinforcement of one hundred and fifty men will be
sent to Van-Yen to protect the valley of Phou-Yen
against a sudden attack. We lend our pirogues for
this purpose, and intend taking advantage of the
delay by visiting the mines situated on the right
bank of the river.


On the morrow the colonel gives us some details
as to the disaster of Yen Lang. The pirates entered
in the evening disguised as coolie porters; one of
them, wearing a helmet, preceded the party on
horseback, and thanks to this disguise he was able to
deceive the sentinel. The gate taken, the remainder
of the men hidden in the wood were called up. The
surprise had succeeded, but it required a great deal
<!-- Leaf 398 -->

<!-- Leaf 318, Page: 302 -->
From the summit of the hill which overlooks the
town I mentally divided it into twelve or fourteen
squares of about the same area, and in one of these
squares I counted 110 houses. Allowing eight
inhabitants to each house, we should have a total of
12,000, and this cannot be far from the truth, for the
Siamese Colonel's list of taxpayers makes the total
about 11,000.


AVith regard to the total population of the State,
Macleod's estimate was only 50,000, but Gamier puts
it at treble, and this is not, I fancy, much off the
mark.


The inhabitants are Kas, Laotians, Lus and Meos,
while there are also a few Chinese traders and
shopkeepers. The Kas, divided into seven tribes, according
to the information obtained by Holt, Hallett and Neis,
are four times more numerous than the Laotians.


For the most part of small stature,1 the Kas are
very dark in complexion and of the same colour all
over the body. Their legs are as a rule thin and their
stomachs protuberant; the nose broad and flat; the
eyes rather elongated; the lips thick and the jaw
prominent, while the forehead is narrow and receding. The
facial angle seems to indicate that they belong to an
inferior race, and, as a matter of fact, they look like
savages by the side of the Laotians. These Kas have
long, straight hair falling over the forehead, in some
cases tied together by a strip of cloth, or else plastered
on the top of the head and fastened at the back in a
chignon. The men wear a large ring in the lobe of
the ear and fill up the interstice with a piece of wood,


1 Those whom we measured averaged about five feet two
inches; the women being smaller.

silver for himself and giving the other seventh to his
workmen.


The abundance of the gold-bearing sands has been
much exaggerated, as I shall have occasion to show,
and concessions which have been obtained by
Europeans, notably around Myduc in the province
of Hanoi, seem likely to be restricted to Chinese.


The copper mines, which are very abundant and
rich in Tonkin, yielded to the treasury a sum of
about £60, by way of tribute, while the iron works
were taxed at 6,000 lbs. weight of that metal, or about
£48 in value, the information gathered by the
missionaries and travellers, as well as that derived from
the documents taken at Hanoi in 1882, show that
other metals have been and still might be extracted,
such as tin, zinc, lead, bismuth and arsenic.


Nor does the mineral wealth of the country end
here, for marble is being worked successfully at
Kecheu by two brothers, very sturdy colonists, whose
example may be commended to the notice of
workmen of small means who may be thinking of
comingout to the colony, prepared to devote all their energies
to the service which they undertake.


Traces of petroleum and naphtha oil have been
discovered in the east, but the region in which they are
situated is still very difficult to explore, and when it
is remembered that, despite the yield of the Burmah
oil wells, casks of petroleum are sent all the way from
Batoum to Siam, it is easy to understand of what
importance the discovery of this oil would be for
French Indo-China.


The salt industry was at one time prosperous upon
the coast of Tonkin, salt being sent into the Yunnan
<!-- Leaf 83, Page: 67 -->
there to plant tobacco upon the eastern coast of the
island at Deli, and in that year he sent home 165
bales of tobacco, which were sold at Amsterdam for
about 25,000 florins. The tobacco was considered
to be exceptionally good, and in 1867-1869 several
companies were formed to obtain large concessions of
land from the Government and to plant tobacco.
The enterprise has since prospered to such an extent
that in 1889 the quantity of tobacco sent from Deli
to Europe, principally to Amsterdam, was over
300,000 bales, representing a total value of over
£3,200,000, and this from a small strip of territory
situated between the Langkat river to the north and
the Batu-Barra river to the south, that is to say
about 70 miles of coast by 30 in breadth, the
interior remaining unexplored.


\"The Government of the Dutch Indies has
succeeded in attracting capital to this country by
very extensive grants of land, some as much as
50,000 acres, upon very liberal terms, for seventy-five
years. As the length of these grants, guaranteed by
the Government, is sufficient to give full security to
capital, there has been a ready flow of it, and a tract
of country which a few years ago was covered with
vast forests, from which the Malay natives only
obtained a little gum and a few canes and poles, has
been made to yield over three million pounds sterling
in a year, certain companies in Holland paying their
shareholders dividends of 110 and 157 per cent. This
phenomenal success has since undergone a check, and
the colony is at present in a very unsettled state.
The planters, whose heads were in many cases turned
by their rapid accession to wealth, began to increase  
  
  
  f 2
<!-- Leaf 323, Page: 307 -->
what the citizens of a small Greek republic might have
been like, and I can fancy the Athenians, putting the
æsthetic sentiment upon one side, to have been of a
like disposition, lazy, fond of gossip, and of an easy
saunter, devoted to flow-ers, women, and music.


The men do but little work, labour in the mines
and the cultivation of the soil being left to the Kas,
and it is only in the towns that they are found
engaging in any artistic occupation, such as the
making of jew-ellery or the chasing of silver. Even
those who do work rarely do so for more than seven
hours a day, and the woman keep the pot boiling by
spinning silk and making various materials, though
they do not overw-ork themselves. AVhen a
household is very hard pressed the men seek employment
as boatmen, and are very expert, making enough in a
month or two to keep them the rest of the year, so
that if there are few large fortunes, most of the
inhabitants have enough to live upon in comfort,
preferring freedom and tranquillity to an excess of
labour, which would only give them what they do not
want. Moreover, when they do happen to have put by
a decent sum of money, they go and spend it at the
pagoda, either in fulfilment of a vow or in payment
of some religious ceremony. This is their only
luxury, nor, indeed, do they regard it as one, for
they reckon upon profiting by it in another world.


There would be but a poor opening for labour here,
as what work has to be done is paid for in kind, one
family helping another. Thus, for instance, let us
suppose that a certain family wants to build a house.
Having gradually got together all the necessary
materials, it calls its neighbours together, and the

blue jacket, red and green trousers, and a hat with
double feathers, are drawn up in line on deck.
Higher up the river a few wooden dams, constructed
many years ago for defensive purposes, have been
kept in repair by the Chinese from a feeling of
suspicion and the force of routine, their idea being
to render access to the " City of Pearls " more
difficult for gunboats in the event of war.


The first impression Canton gives is one of dull
and gray uniformity, with its long stretch of roofs all
of the same height and crowded one upon the other
as far as the eye can reach. There is no break or
sign of any street; only, here and there, a few round
towers which resemble feudal donjons, but are in
reality pawning establishments. The outlines of a
white European church and those of the Catholic
cathedral are also conspicuous, while towards the
horizon appears a line of low hills. A little further
up stream, the breadth of which they help to define,
are a mass of boats, pontoons and junks, connected
more or less securely one with another by small
bridges and forming a sort of floating town.


Canton is a huge ant-hill containino- a million
inhabitants, a half aquatic, half terrestrial ant-hill,
which has been cut down to one level, with here and
there an elevation attesting the former existence of
heights more or less picturesque.


The European concession, which is formed by an
artificial island, is surrounded on all sides by canals.
The French fort, which is barely a third the size of
the English, is a very ramshackle building and our
Consulate is in the English section. Among the 130
or 150 Europeans of Shamen, as the concession is
<!-- Leaf 121, Page: 105 -->
rise in all directions, to the left being visible the
enormous mass of the Bari, which wTe had already
seen from Hanoi, its outlines enveloped in mist
reminding one somewhat of the Fusi-Yama, a
mountain so pure and perfect that it has been styled " the
pearl of Japan." Mount Bari, though it has so far
been very little explored, has delighted botanists by
the wealth and variety of its fauna. There are more
than twenty different kinds of oaks upon its slopes,
but it is impossible to settle there in security. Only
a short time ago, a French family of colonists was
massacred out of sheer vengeance, the father being
bled like a pig, while the son had his throat cut but
w7as not decapitated, this being because his murderers
wanted to indicate that he spoke the language of the
country but made a bad use of it. The mother
was killed in order to get rid of an awkward witness.


Between Mount Bari and the river, and upon the
banks of the latter, stand, like the ruins of some
cathedral overrun by ivy and wild plants, the Notre
Dame rocks, with a small post of soldiers established
upon the platform which serves as a sort of natural fort.


These rocks seem as if they had been reared there by
nature in order to form a gigantic boundary stone for
the limits of the Delta, as the countiy from this point
assumes quite a different aspect, the banks narrowing
so much that in places the current is not more than
from 195 to 330 feet broad, while they are much
higher and are so covered with plants and brushwood
that the rock is entirely hidden from view. In other
places, the brush does not extend all the way down the
cliff, forming a sort of top-knot for it, the flanks being
quite denuded and reminding one of the cliffs in the
<!-- Leaf 176, Page: 160 -->
China, been driven back to the mountains by the
conquerors of the soil; but they avenge themselves by
making incursions into the valleys, from whence they
vainly attempt to expel their spoilers. The Chinese
treat them as barbarians, a generic name, by which
they also designate all those who do not belong to the
honoured race oi pig-tail wearers. In Northern
Tonkin the Meos are tranquilly living on good terms with
the other populations, avoiding as much as possible
all foreign contact; they rarely descend into the
plains for the purpose of commerce or barter; they
are self-supporting, and they assert that the lower air is
pestiferous and fatal to them. Divided into several
tribes according to the colour of their clothes, they
pay a small tax to the chiefs of the canton, through
the medium of their own chieftains. It wull enable the
reader to know them more thoroughly if he will follow
us to a Meo village, situated at the back of Van Bou.


Lieutenant Didelot agrees to act as our guide in
this excursion, which is made (including the journeys
there and back) in one day; but the ascent is steep
and fatiguing-; the sides of the hills are cleared to a
certain height for the cultivation of the gluey mountain
rice, which does not require irrigation or any particular
care; the ashes of the burnt wood serve as manure for
the land, but in any case the inhabitants never sow
the rice twice in succession on the same spot.


We soon enter the clouds, to pass out again almost
immediately, and at our feet we behold only a white
sea, extending far beyond our sight in every direction,
with a few bare peaks emerging from it; one last
ascent over the red earth and we reach our
destination. The pass where we have stopped is 3,400 feet
<!-- Leaf 93, Page: 77 -->
of two feet, the advantage of which was that it would
adapt itself more readily to the irregularities of the
ground. As to the contractor, he insisted upon the
application of the original survey to the new line, in
order to have more work and embankments to execute.
Moreover, the representative of M. Souppe did not seem
to have the necessary competence for the direction
ofthe works, and the Government engineer
accordingly offered to help him with his staff. But this
course was disapproved of by the contractors in Paris,
who obtained the recall of M. Lion, the State engineer,
who, however, has since been sent back to Tonkin as
consulting engineer to the Government.
O O


After his departure, some important concessions
were made to the contractors, who were allowed,
upon the ground that the line had not been
commenced properly, to do over again a sixth of the
eleven or twelve miles already laid, and this at a
cost to the country of between thirty and forty
thousand piastres.


They were also allowed to do what had hitherto
been refused, that is, instead of paying the
workmen by the hour, to do the work by piece, this
system being more advantageous to the contractors
than to the State. Moreover, when in the course
of making the road, a very difficult bit of work
was encountered, the route was altered, and near
Bac-Le five different plans were adopted, the one
after the other, until, when the embankment
constructed towards the end had been washed away,
a sixth had to be prepared and carried out.


Moreover, how is it possible for an enterprise to
be properly managed when it passes through so
<!-- Leaf 128, Page: 112 -->
of Central Asia. A house of a kind which is quite
new to me, in front of which we halt, brings me back
to reality. It is the kind of building that we shall meet
with everywhere in Indo-China except in the deltas—
a single storey, which is reached by a ladder or outward
staircase, is built upon piles to a height generally
varying from five-and-a-half to six feet. This
arrangement enables the inmates to have their stable and their
poultry house and even to tie up their horses just
beneath them, so that they are more easily protected
from wild animals; this elevation above the ground in
a measure preserves them from the emanations of fever,
which often arise from the moisture. The construction
is either rectangular or is formed of buildings arranged
on three sides of a square. The roof is thatched,
the walls consisting either of planks or of bamboo,
closely interwoven, which are kept in their places by
beams, and the wooden flooring- is covered with bamboo
mats, while in the houses of the chiefs a slightly raised
portion has a small table upon which tea is served to
visitors. At the other end of the apartment a square
space covered with slabs cemented together with
beaten earth serves as a fireplace, and the smoke
makes its way up to the roof, the beams of wdiich are
quite blackened. The sides of the room instead of
being perpendicular to each other and to the floor, in
many cases form slightly obtuse angles, the upper
part being thus slightly broader than the lower part,
thus making corners in which the inmates deposit or
hang up provisions of all kinds without encroaching
upon the available space. This is why one can
distinguish at a glance the Thai houses of the Siamese,
all of which are rectangular. After taking a cup of
<!-- Leaf 216, Page: 200 -->
regions. The dead leaves are still hanging from the
trunks like a fantastic dress; the whole scene is strange,
and one fancies that an antediluvian landscape must
have been just like it. For my own part I soon weary
of the calm and solitude, and prefer returning to the
river side.


Iu the evening we witness a spectacle which is both
grandiose and alarming, for part of the mountain is on
fire. A crackling, which is heard even on the river
bank, first announces the scourge, then we see
columns of thick smoke, followed by a strong red
light; a band of fire is licking the ridges and
embracing- the hills, surrounding them with a shining
ribbon. One pass is outlined by the flames and appears
against the sky like a gigantic glittering- V. The river
is quiet here, and reflects the fiery garland like the
waters of a peaceful lake.


Instinctively I recall the illuminations which
are lighted in our cities on festival days, the
small lamps which decorate our monuments. How
shabby it all seems compared to the brilliant
radiance which we are watching here ! The scene is so
wild, so grand, that I ask myself if it cannot be
perpetuated more certainly than in our memory, and my
apparatus is soon ready. Alas ! it is useless. The
spectacle which we are witnessing is one of those
which impress the sight, but which cannot be
reproduced by any practical means; science is
sometimes powerless to transmit a thing so great in itself.
Defining- a perception sometimes appears to dwarf it,
and it is better in that case to content one's self with
the impression received, and to endeavour to recall it,
on our return home, as little spoilt as possible.
<!-- Leaf 132, Page: 116 -->
escorted to the raised platform, where a repast is
served us in an infinity of small dishes, while,
facing us, above an altar covered with pots
containing peacock feathers and scented bits of wood, are
long inscriptions in Chinese, this being the altar of
the ancestors. Prayers on behalf of relatives and
practices relating to spirits comprise the whole
religious worship of the natives in this district, to
which Buddhism has not yet penetrated.


Our host is a quamlong or village chief, and as
the country is under the feudal regime, the
quamlongs are independent of each other, but they neariy
all recognize a certain vassaldom with regard to the
Zinhs, the family of which formerly governed
Tonkin. The tribute paid to Annam was ve^
small, the Court of Hue scarcely making its yoke
felt, and merely requiring the Muongs to furnish a
certain number of soldiers, who were very much
dreaded until the use of our long-range guns became
known. This year we have exempted the chiefs
from taxation, upon condition of their making roads,
and they seem to have taken their task quite to heart,
despite the difficulties of all kinds which they are
constantly encountering.


The term of Muong which is applied to them is
not quite accurate, for it means, strictly speaking,
\"provincial," but it is not a term of reproach, like
that of Mois (savage). This latter name seems to be
reserved for certain tribes disseminated over various
parts of Tonkin, especially half way up the
mountains. The natives of this part style
themselves Thos-dan, which means strictly
speakinginhabitants of the earth (tho), but they are often
<!-- Leaf 117, Page: 101 -->
what are strictly necessaries, and that is not very
much.


But as it is my intention to make as many
collections as possible en route, we decided to provide
ourselves with materials of quite another kind, such,
for instance, as arsenical soap, alum, and what is
needed for stuffing birds, a salt barrel for the
mammiferæ, and brine being the best of all
preservatives, it is desirable to carry as much of that as possible.
When wre get towards the sources of the Black River,
I intend to give what salt remains over to the natives,
who are certain to be highly pleased with such a
present. A second empty barrel and a supply of
acetate of soda will enable us to bring back a few fish,
this kind of salt being more suitable than alcohol
when one is travelling. The insects are to be preserved
in sawdust and naphthaline, while we have to take
a large quantity of paper for wrapping up the
specimens and the grasses, a few snares, some
strychnine, safetv cartridges for fishing, alcohol and silk
nets, completing our natural history outfit.


In the way of photography, I have two cameras,
one of them, a Nadar detective, 11 x 18, being that
which M. Bonvalot and myself took with us through
Thibet, and it is very good as regards its
objective and its solidity. The other, rather lighter, is
constructed upon the same pattern, each piece, each
screw and each spring of these cameras taking to
pieces, and I have a double set of everything, so that
we shall be able to have 120 photographs in
preparation at the same time. As upon previous
occasions I have provided myself wTith the Eastman
Film, which gives good, though not always very
<!-- Leaf 268, Page: 252 -->
the natives endeavour to make an exorbitant profit
Out of the post, and M. Gassouin has been obliged to
establish an average rate of prices: 7\d. for a
chicken, one \d. for an egg, 2s. for a picul of rice;
and he has made the sale at this price compulsory.


The natives, who are now governed with justice,
begin to find M. Gassouin's rule more advantageous
than that of a mandarin, they even go so far as to
entrust their children to him; one of the sergeants
has transformed himself into a professor, and he now
has five pupils. A school has been created, benches
and desks have been made out of wooden cases, and
black boards have been cut on the spot. A great
difficulty then presented itself, the sergeant could not
speak the Thai language, but what apparently seemed
an insurmountable obstacle proved nothing in his
hands (without wishing to compliment ourselves, I
have always found Frenchmen far from home
particularly ingenious). Our schoolmaster first shows
his pupils some objects, then tells them their names,
he writes them down, then teaches the children first
the syllables, then the letters. The little scholars
copy, remember, and finally understand; some of them
can say a few words already. In writing they found
great difficulty in holding the pen on one side, instead
of grasped like a paint-brush, but at last they have
managed it. They are more industrious than children
with us, for when the professor leaves the room, they
continue working uninterruptedly. In the villages
the children play very little; one sees them
sittingimpassive, their arms crossed, dreaming or rather
resigned before their time; one might suppose that
fatality had stamped them with its finger from their
<!-- Leaf 186, Page: 170 -->
which two horses can stand; the weather is dull; the
thermometer registers 77 F. in the day. We are on
horseback as well as the interpreter Clio-Ken; four
Muong sharp-shooters accompany us and serve as our
guides; our troop is augmented by a dozen coolies
and by our boys.


After repassing the Chinese Van Bou, where I
admire the thick groves of enormous tangerine trees,
we leave the river bank to ascend the valley of one of
its affluents, the Nam-Bou. This is only a torrent of
muddy water, which runs by the side of a good road;
at times the rock encroaches upon the pathway and
we walk upon mats of crossed bamboo, supported by
piles.


The halting places for the coolies are marked by
shelters, a thatched roof upon four posts. Near one
of them, whilst luncheon is being prepared, I find
in the wood a human skull, a skeleton, a blanket
belonging to the administration and a cangue.
What are these remains, and what tragedy has been
played here ? The bones are mute; we may suppose
that an escaped prisoner has reached here to die of
hunger or disease, or to fall a prey to the wild beasts.


As we advance the woods increase in size; fig-trees
with ribbed trunks always predominate. Palm-trees
rear their long and elegant stems from the ground; they
attain the height of fifteen or twenty feet. The ferns
are superb, but they are not arborescent. We are on a
slatey soil, and in certain places the passers-by have
erected some large slabs.


We gradually ascend as we pass from one basin
to the other, while bamboos and reeds replace
the large trees. The country has few inhabitants;
<!-- Leaf 183, Page: 167 -->
have brought back to us. Before giving an opinion,
we ought to have more abundant information on the
subject.


They tell us that they have no writing, and they
appear to worship ancestors or spirits. A small square
of gilded paper at the back of the houses, a few
small sticks of perfume, one or two eggs, some cut
paper—-this is all that forms and decorates the altar.
At the entrance a suspended keg, upholding an
outstretched skin, and a tambourine are used in honour
of the dead. The arts are greatly neglected; they
have a kind of guitar and a reed, to the sounds of
which they dance, and the fact that they have dances
is interesting, for in that respect they are distinct
from the Chinese, who have none, and from the Thais,
who only dance at certain religious ceremonials. I
remark some drawings which have been made on a
board; they are very primitive, and resemble in
appearance those that may be found in Oceania, in
the heart of Africa, or upon the carved bones of
prehistoric ages.


We have a good look round, and the inhabitants,
who do not interfere with us, are most obliging, letting
us examine their houses, sitting for photographs
full face and in profile, and putting on their grand
costumes. As we come down, we halt at an altitude
of about 2,200 feet near a spring, at a sanitorium
which Colonel Pennequin is establishing for the use
of invalids or of men requiring a rest; here it is
always five degrees cooler than at Van Bou. Three
or four bamboo huts have been erected in a few
hours; a small garden with some radishes, cabbages,
and four stems of wild vine at present form the
<!-- Leaf 127, Page: 111 -->
each other, which is the essential point, and without
being aware of it Yao renders more valuable service
to the French Republic than any of the interpreters
of the block house. Four hours below Cho-Bo wTe
stop on the right bank at Phuong'-Lam, our horses
having been sent forward with some sharpshooters
by boat. Several chiefs have come to meet us dressed
in robes of brown silk and barefooted. They are rather
above the average height, with fair complexion and
prominent cheek bones, but the foreheads do not
recede so much as those of the Annamites, and most
of them wear a short beard, which tends to give them
a more energetic appearance. At Phuong'-Lam, as
{empty}M. Vacle tells us, the chief is celebrated for his
remarkably well-trained dogs, two of which act as
keepers for the rest. At a given time troughs are put
down for the pack, upon the beating of the tam-tam
each animal takes up his place in front of his portion,
but it is only upon the second stroke of the tam-tam he
is allowed to touch it. We had not however time to
wait and see this done, as we were obliged to mount
our horses and get on. The weather is magnificent
and the sun warm without being too hot, so that we
have not put on our sun helmets, large felt hats wTith
a handkerchief underneath them being sufficient to
protect us. For my own part I feel myself quite at
home on horseback, and with my saddle-bag filled with
different articles which may be useful on the road,
my rifle slung across my shoulder, my revolver, my
compass, my barometer and my thermometer,
everything strikes me as being very familiar, and I feel
tempted to call out to my former companions in
Thibet to ask them if we. are not still in some corner

one picul of cotton, bought upon the Nam-Ma and
sent to Mongtze\


In the evening our attention is drawn towards a
series of detonations, which seem to come from a
neighbouring hill; they are too frequent to be
attributed to sportsmen, and I inquire if by any
chance a war is going on here, but the natives hasten
to explain the cause of the noise—some woods are
burning, and the bamboos are splitting, so there, is
no reason to trouble ourselves about it.  
  
  
  March 8th.


A few minutes after starting we pass a wooden
scaffolding recalling the stone toros placed at the
entrance of Japanese temples. Here two vertical beams
ornamented with a trellis of bamboos support one
horizontal one. The whole edifice marks the boundary
of the village land, and on one day of the year
consecrated to the invocation of the spirits, no one but the
inhabitants is allowed to cross it; in some centres the
festival is repeated twice a year.


Although villages are rare, the road is pretty well
frequented, and we pass some more caravans of salt and
cotton; the plant is cultivated in this district by the
Yaos. AVe see a few natives busily grubbing with
mattocks in some soil that has lately been cleared of
its wood by fire, and in the morning we pass through
a small Yao village. The inhabitants assert that they
are natives of Kouitcheou, but they must have left
that province about twenty years ago.


They have a great variety of fishing tackle in their
houses. Near the altar stands a lance decorated

Tonkin, and end by bringing its wealth of
merchandise to the clocks of Chung-King. Thus would be
o o
fulfilled the hope of the Anglo-Indian Chambers of
Commerce, who have conceived this great idea, and
who are working with the tenacity of the
AngloSaxon race at the colossal enterprise of linking
Calcutta to Shanghai across the Celestial Empire.


The race between us and the English has begun,
O O *
the goal being the markets of South-AVestern China.
The starting signal was given on the one hand by the
taking of Tonkin, and on the other by that of Burmah.
AVe are from every point of view ahead. AVe arc so
far well in advance, in regard to geography, time, and
distance, and there is no reason why we should not
win in a canter. But there is no time to be lost, and
over-confidence, preventing practical action, would be
fatal to our interests. Our rivals are alert and alive
to the magnitude of their task, so we must be up
and doing.


Having endeavoured to lift a corner of the veil of
the future, I return to the present. From Moulmein
to Xienghoung, a distance of 625 miles, is a journey
of about two months for a caravan, and from
Xienghoung to Stemao one of twelve days, that is,
about seventy days from a Burmah pert to Stemao.
It is nearly the same for Tali.


Now from Haiphong to Laichau it takes from
twenty-one to twenty-two days, and thence Ibang,
which is the centre of tea growing, and the starting
point of most of the caravans that lay in their stocks
for the Shan countries, for Tali or for the Yangtze, is
reached in seventeen clays by easy stages.
<!-- Leaf 70, Page: 54 -->
in baskets suspended to the two ends of a bamboo
which rests on the shoulders. They wear turbans, and
most of them are attired in long smocks, while others
wear pantaloons, which, it is said, Minh-Mang ordered
to be worn in order to check the licentiousness which
prevailed. This edict was so untimely that it led to a
bloody revolt. Jealous of their rights and their mode
of dress, the Annamite women have very distinct
characteristices, and it is only with them that one
sees the indolent carriage which they affect, with
their thighs outstretched and their haunches moving
as in the dance. This natural attitude, due in the
main to their conformation, is perhaps one of the
most marked characteristics of the race of the
GiaoChi, which is quite distinct from the Chinese. They
have good busts, and the face would often be pleasing
if they could hide the mouth; but the new-comer is
horrified to see their thick, swollen and split lips open
and display a cavity with black teeth, often very
decayed, and what looks like bloody saliva, Still
more surprised is he when this cavity opens to let drop
into the mouth of two or three children some
halfmasticated rice. Yet there is nothing but what is
natural in all this. The black is due to the habit of
lacquering the teeth and the red to the chewing of the
betel-nut, while as to masticating the children's food
in advance, I have heard the doctors say that it is a
very good plan. After a few months' time, one
grows accustomed to anything, and as these
Annamite ladies put up with our white teeth—dog's teeth,
as they call them—I hope they will excuse my
remarks.  
  
  
  After having seen the market, we must go and

<!-- Leaf 124, Page: 108 -->
the massacre of the garrison, and the seizure of 30,000
cartridges and of several rapid-firing rifles. Yet
there had been no lack of warnings, for M. Piquet,
the Governor-General, had been told by M. Pavie
of what was likely to happen, and several native
chiefs themselves had intimated that they could no
longer be answerable for the inhabitants. M. Rougerie
thought that he was a match for them all, and,
trusting in his own powers, he despised the advice
dictated to him by experience, though as he paid for
his error with his life, we must hope that the earth
rests lightly upon him.


The Government recognized its mistakes, the
selection of M. Vacle being a proof of this, and the
universal confidence which he inspired justifies it. The
same natives who before paid the Doc Ngu to avenge
them, now paying him a tithe, though in the present
instance it is to get him to spare Cho-Bo and all its
inhabitants. The feeling of confidence does not,
however, imply lack of precaution, and there is no
risk of appearing ridiculous when one loads one's
rifle or revolvers before going off to sleep—always
with one eye open. Excepting the bands of the
Doc Ngu, composed partly of Annamites, partly
of Chinese formerly belonging to the yellow flags of
Phu-Yen, the natives of Cho-Bo and of the
neighbourhood are for the most part peaceably disposed.


We are here at the dividing point of two re<nons

This is a pretty warm clay, 84 degrees in the shade,
but it does not hinder us from doing the greater
part of the march on foot. We do not, however, get
much game, though there are plenty of traces of stags,
all that we see being a few plover, some swallows, and
some very large and wild kingfishers. The river winds
about a great deal, with large accumulations of stone
in the bends, while at the angles, between the hills and
the river, there is a sort of plateau, probably formed
by the accumulated deposits of long ages. There are
but few villages, and we pitch our camp near a
collection of some twenty houses, close to it being a
cemetery similar to one which I have already
described. The natives come and sell us a pineapple and
a young porcupine, which is here called a mountain
pig, but as we do not know what to do with it we
decline to accept it.  
  
  
  February 8th.


The hills seem to be denuded upon the tops, the
natives cutting down the trees for fuel, for building
and for clearing land which will be suitable for rice
or Indian corn. The big trees on the river bank
are, however, left, in order that they may serve as
shelter for the yehW-roofed houses which, emerging
from the verdure, remind one of various Japanese
sketches. At other points, the banana-trees,1 with

from France to Tonkin, than from'France to Shanghai,
and much less than from England to Shanghai.


{empty}2. The situation of Lao-Kai on French territory
at the very gates of the Celestial Empire will give
the Chinese merchant a market where he may satisfy
his requirements gradually, without accumulating a
stock of goods, weighed clown with heavy duties,
which he cannot get rid of.


{empty}3. Most important of all, w-e can send to China
the agricultural and industrial products of Tonkin.
Cotton threads for instance, and stuffs made in our
colony will have, over similar products of Bombay
and Calcutta, to mention only the nearest points of
English industrial activity, the double advantage of
being within easier reach and of being turned out
more cheaply, while it must not be forgotten, that we
have coal on the spot.


And I make no mention here of the numerous
industries, the natural outlets of which would be the
frontier provinces of Tonkin.


Assuredly the time is distant, if indeed it ever
comes, when the products of Tonkin will possess, by
the disappearance of freight charges to the far East,
a sufficient saving over European or even Indian
products to be able to compete with them in the north
or even the east of Chung-King, in the most populous
district of eastern Setchuen.


But, on the other hand, we need not be frightened
at the efforts of the English. For on the upper
Yangtze the coast is clear. AVe have only to follow
their example and enter into competition with them
in these regions.

called Thos, short. There is a great similarity between
this name and that of Hos, which is given to the
Chinese of the highlands, and also between that of
Thai, Thou, Theugon, which is the denomination of
a whole race. But I shall have another opportunity
of dealing in more detail with the still obscure
question of the Indo-Chinese races.


In reply to our interrogations, the thos chiefs
assert that their people have always been settled
here, and that they have not come by a series of
migrations.


The Annamites, as our interpreter, whom I
shrewdly suspect of not being any too pure in blood,
tells me, are a cross between the Chinese and the
Mois. I don't know whether this view, which
would reflect upon their national pride, would be
much appreciated by our boys, and moreover the
historical information given by the natives possesses
little scientific value, unless backed up by
corroborative evidence. Still it is well to disregard no sort of
information, and my plan is to question as much as
possible, for in time light is certain to spring from a
comparison of the documentary and verbal evidence
accumulated.


While we are discussing these ethnographical
problems; our men are talking, as they sit round the
fire, to the women who are getting the food ready.
The Muong women, with their big, round heads, the
weather-beaten aspect of which is in sharp contrast
to the whiteness of their arms and chests, can scarcely
be called pretty. Instead of wearing Annamite
turbans, they use a dark silk handkerchief as a
head-covering, the dress being held up by a large

inches thick gives as much heat as a layer three
times as thick of Japan coal; but the fire must be
kept well banked up with a good flame. No special
grates are used, and we are assured that the use of
Tonkin coal unmixed effects a saving of 25 per cent

upon that of Japan.

Experiments made at Oxford have shown that
tie Hong-Hay and Cardiff coals are identical, and
the principal difficulty experienced is in lighting it,
what is required being a well-fed fire and a strong
draught.


Be this as it may, Hong-Hay coal is now used,
to great advantage, in a large sugar refinery, and
it is also burnt upon two ferries in the harbour of
Hong-Kong. Two government transports have just
taken in 500 tons, and the 2,000 tons just
brought in by a collier have been rapidly sold off
at eight dollars a ton for the lump, and five for
the dust. Since the beginning of December (1891),
nearl}T 6,000 tons have been despatched from
Hong-Hay.


This is a by no means inconsiderable result, but
Mr. Chater hopes to do much more, and says that in
a couple of months' time the company will have two,
if not three, ships freighted instead of one. Another
working will shortly be connected with the wharf at
Hong-Hay, and then there will be an output of as
much as twenty, or even thirty, thousand tons a month.
This coal will be sent as far north as Shanghai, and as
far south as Singapore and Colombo, the price at first
being 32s., the same as the Cardiff coal, but it will
be reduced in a short time. The return freight will
be made up of Java sugar, and the travellers who

As we cross the stream, we notice all along the
banks tiny rafts conveying presents, notably rice,
and these are offerings made by the boatmen in order
that they may take plenty of fish, and be favoured
by the weather w-hile out with their boats.


In the town the statues are still out in the open,
or rather they are placed under a small scaffolding,
the sacred water conduit pouring out its contents
drop by drop through the dragon's mouth in which
it terminates at one end, while the other end is in
the pagoda and is being fed by the priests, long tapers
with strips of paper bearing the donor's name are

burning before the altar.


In the main street we encounter a cortege which is
coming from Ouate Tate to Ouate Sieng Tong, and
this is supposed to be the old year which is being
thus escorted. It is curious, in this connection, to
note that the old year is fetched from the west, while
the new year will come from the east, but I do not
know whether this is due to chance or is a matter of
tradition.


Be this as it may, the order and composition of
the procession are regulated by rites of very
longstanding. At the head of the procession march
young men with flowers in their hands, then two
rows of bearers of red and white umbrellas for the
temple, behind them coming six or eight men
carrying upon their shoulders one of those gilt chairs
which are used in the pagodas as pulpits, and upon
which one of the principal bonzes is seated. He is
accompanied by two guards, who have in their hands

  March 31 st.


During the day we pass some fine rapids through
which our steersmen guide us with their usual
success; there are a great many islets in the river,
and some of them are covered with a pile of the
trunks of trees, which they have caught during the
floods.


The sun is hot in the afternoon, and it penetrates
into every corner of the pirogues in spite of the
strawa wnings; we are obliged to stop up the chinks with
handkerchiefs and wrappers. The days pass very
quickly in our boats; with reading, studying maps,
notes, and photography, we have no time to get
weary. Besides, watching our boatmen would be
sufficient to occupy us, for they are a very interesting
study; their chief pre-occupation is to point out
some game to us, and with this aim they search
the banks with their eyes. The steersman seems
particularly fond of hunting, and he is doubly keen
upon it now, for he has all the men to feed, so he is
not at all sorry to give them some monkey flesh or a
few birds, which do not cost him anything.


AVe shall also be glad to vary and lengthen our
own bid of fare, for we appear likely to run short of
necessary food at the stage; for the villages refuse to
sell us anything, and we are obliged to use the same
threats as the other day, before we can obtain any
good from these distrustful natives.


Our men, however, have one resource, which 1
cannot make up my mind to try; they have picked
up a kind of cricket on the banks, and after amusing
themselves by making it chirp as they hold it between
<!-- Leaf 312, Page: 296 -->

In this district, for instance, the king had perhaps
formerly less authority; the villages were subject to
him by the ties of vassaldom, and, being impelled
by a community of interests, formed a federation
round the town as a common centre; and Luang
Prabang provided a body of militia but did not find
any forced labour.


Now, we find that a people is being formed;
if there is not a sentiment of nationality the
o-overning power is becoming autocratic and an
administrative centralization is being effected to its
profit, under the control and the direction of the
Siamese. The local rulers are in communication
with Bangkok, even if they have not been on a visit
there; they are learning to appreciate luxury, and
they are upon the point of arming their troops with
European weapons, of increasing their effective, and
lending aid to the forces of the invaders. In order
to obtain these charming results of what may be
called "the new civilisation," much money is needed,
but if the king's expenditure has increased it has not
been so with the earnings of the people. The latter
were not consulted when a tax was put upon opium
\"for their good," when the tchoum-tchoum was
made a monopoly, or -when a capitation tax of eight
rupees for each man and six for each woman was
imposed. The consequence is that they are
discontented and unable to make any further payments,
mandarins from all parts of the kingdom writing that
the villagers are willing enough to come to the capital
and take the oath, but empty-handed. Last year
several had to sell what they possessed, and now
they are endeavouring to borrow, and are murmuring

grand monument), which is situated upon a
grassyeminence, the temple being white in colour and
having a double roof of light tiles. This building
seems bright and trim by comparison with those
already visited, but when we come to examine it
more closely we find that the medallions of carved
wood between the two roofs are of considerable
antiquity, while the interior is not so interesting as
that of several others. It is here that the king and
the people confer the principal religious orders, and
this is why it is called the royal pagoda. I may add
that there are several small pagodas of less
importance upon the right bank. Having endeavoured
to portray in the preceding pages the habits and
mode of life of a Laos state and to describe its
capital, I may devote a few words to the New Year
fetes at Luang Prabang, of which I was fortunate
enough to be a spectator.  
  
  
  April Wth.


This is a day of great rejoicing, being the
celebration of the Mahason crane pal (the calendar being
finished goes away), the change of year being
observed here in the fifth month, instead of in the
fourth as at Nan. This and the rejoicings in the
twelfth month are the two most important of the
fetes held in nearly every week of the year. This
fete is very similar to that of the Annamite Tet,
except that here it extended over nearly a fortnight.

AVe pay an early visit to the market and find the
streets crowded, the women being attired in their
finest things, and being loaded with bracelets and
necklaces of gold, while the market itself is full of

this speech, which, made in 1888, is often referred to
by M. de Lanessan in his work and which still holds
true. It is very instructive, as showing one aspect of
the future which I have attempted to delineate.


The public should be brought to understand the
grandeur of the work which has fallen to France for
execution in Indo-China; to realize the means hitherto
employed in carrying it to a successful completion;
to pass its judgment upon the individuals engaged
in it; to feel what are the faults which have been
committed; and to learn by the experience which has
been acquired the remedies most suitable for
application. But this examination of affairs might entail
a very serious danger. Some people, finding how
many faults had been committed might be tempted
to confuse the administered with the administrators,
and to conclude from the meagre result hitherto
allowed that Tonkin is not worth what it cost to
conquer. Such an idea would be erroneous. Because
{empty}.a farmer manages his land badly and does not make
the most of it, does it follow that the land is bad ?
What, too, should the owner do who does not get his
rent ? Surely not sell very cheap what had cost him
dear, but preserve what he had got and secure a fresh
steward. Above all, I should, were it my case, consult
men of wide experience, see what course those of my
neighbours who had been successful had followed, and
take into consideration the views of those who had
been over my property.


In this case, those who have endeavoured to bring
the whole truth before the public, will, whatever errors

they have made, be quite easy in their minds, and I,
for my own part, am quite prepared for any retort or

  CHAPTER VIII.

Our Return.—From Luang Prabang to Bangkok—On the

Mekong; Rapids—Paklay; Court of Love—Upon Elephants

in the Forest—The Menam; the Chinese; the Trade—Pae

Nam Po; Europeans—Bangkok.

Having decided to leave Luang Prabang for
Bangkok, I have the choice of four principal routes;
through Xieng Mai and Raheng down the Meping;
through Nan going directly overland from Luang
Prabang to the Menam; through Paklay, spending
some days in descending the Mekong, and going on
then to strike the Menam at Pitchai or Ontaradit;
and finally by Nong Kay on the Mekong and thence
to Korat. Our state of health and also the lateness
of the season leads us to adopt the shortest of these,
vid Paklay, which has, moreover, to my eyes, this
advantage, that it is one of the most frequented
of the trade routes, and will give me some idea of the
navigation of the Mekong.


On April 17th in the afternoon, we bid good-bye
to MM. Massie and Counillon, and to all the officials
at the consulate, and set out. Our boat is large and
comfortable, being a palace in comparison with the
canoes of the Black River or the Nam Ou. A
bamboo flooring is placed on two parallel canoes the
<!-- Leaf 288, Page: 272 -->
which corresponds with an eccentric, it is also furnished
with a flywheel (the machine is made entirely of
wood). After the cotton is cleaned it is placed in
baskets, about twenty-four inches high and ten wide.
AVhen full they are sold for one rupee each.


Elsewhere the spun cotton is being dyed, while other
women are making a blue stuff, crossed with yellow
threads. They are seated, and use a wreaving loom
with two pedals, two shuttles, and three small boards.
They throw one shuttle after the movement of the
two small boards, and the other after the third.
Tobacco is being dried on some bamboos and further
away another group is winding silk.


On the whole, I find much more activity here than
amongst the inhabitants of the Black River.


The children often wear a silver collar round the
neck, and sometimes a bracelet on the ankles. Some
of them are tattooed yellow, and a horse is represented
upon the leg of one child. Men, women and children
come to visit us whilst we eat; the)- bring us some
rather pretty stuff for sale, and prefer money to
payments in kind. The women consider our stock
very attractive, but they could not sell it again.
They accept some pictures as a present (these are
easily carried and very well received in these regions),
but their husbands take most of them away again.


An hour's halt is sufficient, and we soon enter a
wilder country. On our right stands a perpendicular
calcareous cliff, and a series of strata appear vertically
on the surface. A fissure between two of them, like
the one already noticed at Sou La, also marks the
entrance to a grotto. The Tham Pa Kouang (grotto of
the great stag) is celebrated, and it well repays a visit.
<!-- Leaf 151, Page: 135 -->
which leads after a two days' march to Songella, and
our only capture is a large water turtle.  
  
  
  February 3rd.


Our men inform us that if we are to be attacked, it
wUl be to-day, for the chief of the village has seen
a crow that has croaked three times, and that is a bad
sigu. The boatmen, however, are pretty easy in their
minds, the presence of Monsieur Vacle inspiring them
with more confidence than that of the ten Muong
soldiers armed with flint locks who have been told off
for us. The chalk cliffs are succeeded by hills, the
sides of wdiich are not so steep, these latter being
clothed with forests in which the painter would find
every possible shade of green. The trees are some of
them very big and majestic, others slender and elegant,
from the gigantic " ficus " with its whitened trunk to
the bamboos whose delicate featherings lend a silky
down to the slopes which they cover. The river is
over two hundred feet broad, and winds about to such
an extent that it seems as if one wrere shut in by
some large lake, while the villages are very far apart,
in most cases hidden in the woods. M. Vacle calls
a halt at the residence of a small chief whom we
consult with respect to the pirates. He says, " If you
insist upon it, I will be answerable for the road
beingsafe, but I cannot guarantee for the canoes that may
come later on." It is not for us to ask him in what way
he can guarantee our freedom from attack, we have
merely to accept the situation. This quamlong wears
a jade bracelet on his left arm, and many of the chiefs
wear silver rings. He is smoking a " hubble-bubble,"
<!-- Leaf 399, Page: 383 -->
ascend the Menam in the rainy season, and all we
now have to do is to traverse as quickly as possible
the intervening distance separating us from Bangkok.
And yet, although, or rather because we are in a
halfcivilised country, this last stage seems to me, if not
the most severe, at all events the most wearisome.
AVe seem for ever on the way. The country, too,
reminds me, in its monotony, of that of the lower
Red River, or of certain parts of the Ganges.
Lowbluffs are surmounted by dirty villages less
picturesque than those of the Mekong. It is only a
few days' journey above Bangkok that we begin to
find the aspect of the country more varied, with
pagodas, here and there the piles of which are buried
in the water, and with the ruins of ancient cities
whose gray tints are lost in the invading foliage.


AVith out the picturesqueness belonging to the
up country rivers, the valley of the Menam, from a
commercial point of view, would nevertheless furnish
matter for a particularly interesting study, being
populous and given over to trade.


I have already said that it is to the forcible
depopulation of the valley of the Mekong by Siam that
the Menam Aralley owes a part of its inhabitants.


Siamese and Laotians are brothers. Both are
Thais, and with some slight differences speak and
write the same language.


By the side of the native populations we find the
Chinese element. Here, as elsewhere, we shall see
them holding the purse strings and continually filling
their pockets at the cost of the inhabitants among
w-hom they live. AVhile the latter are indolent and
very lazy, working only to live, the Chinese lives only
<!-- Leaf 371, Page: 355 -->
standard of Luang Prabang is white, with a
particoloured dragon like that of China, while a second
white flag with a red border, upon which can be
traced the outlines of an elephant, must be Siamese.


The soldiers are followed by the musicians and
certain instruments, such as the drums and the cymbals,
are placed upon a wooden square which is suspended
by ropes from the shoulders of several bearers, the
player marching in the centre. Then come more
soldiers, naked to the waist, sword-bearers,
lancebearers, and cane-bearers, the canes being tied up with
some red material in bundles.


Last of all conies the king, seated upon a very
small gilt throne with no dome to it and borne by
eight men, facing the king being two children on
their knees. He is wearing a small white jacket, a
silken langout'i and a rather dirty old gray helmet,
with an European sunshade in his hand; the rear guard
is formed by young Laotians, intoxicated with
tchoumtchoum, many of them bearing upon their faces
marks of the mud thrown by the young girls.  
  
  
  April 16th.


This is a day of rest, so far as the official fetes are
concerned, but, as one of the chief bonzes puts it,
\"the women are pleased, and therefore they sing." I
have said enough to show how much there is of interest
to be seen and observed in the streets of Luang Prabang
itself, but a longer and more varied experience is
required to describe the habits and environments of a
people; the conditions of climate and the nature of
the soil, its means of defence and its natural resources.

Owing to the pressure of the lituong, we are able
to buy several complete costumes without any
difficulty; but it is impossible to find any manuscripts
or pang-pas like those which Mr. Bourne sent to
London, and M. Vacle to the School for Oriental
languages. The best that I can obtain is a book
in Chinese characters, which they tell us is 200
years old. In the afternoon we return to our night's
lodging at Tai su Kiao. Before leaving I usurp
the functions of doctor and give a consultation to
the chief of the district; the latter has complained
of colic for some days, and he wishes for some tafia.
I explain, to his great regret, that brandy is very
bad in his case, and give him some bismuth pills; he
thanks me, but somewhat sadly.


AVhen we reach the extremity of the plateau I
cannot help thinking of the magnificent racecourse
which could be made here; one mound seems expressly
destined for the erection of a grand stand. I mentally
plan all the necessary arrangements, and find a place
for the paddock already marked, nothing is missing.
A town may some clay be founded here. The ancients,
before they established themselves anywhere, installed
their lares as protectors of their homes. In Asia, a
mosque, a pagoda, or even a simple shelter where
sticks of perfume may be burnt, is erected. We
others, men of civilisation and progress, first look out
for a racecourse; at Hanoi the grand stands were built
before the hospital. After all, it may be that the
English have spread the fashion of horse-racing as a
means of diffusing their language. Now there is not
a single part of the world, not one coast, that has not
its racecourse. The result is a population of horses

tea with our host we make a fresh start, forming a
long caravan, for in addition to our boys, our
interpreters, and several sharpshooters that we have brought
with us, the chiefs precede us on horseback. Our
baggage is carried by people of the country by means
of long bamboos which they sling between them over
their shoulders. About twenty armed natives follow
us wearing a vest loose down to the belt, reminding
one of the Chinese " Makouazere," wide baggy
trousers, short at the knees, and small turban round
the head, with the feet bare and the calves of the legs
bound with strips of cloth. Into the belt is thrust a
double-edged knife with a wooden sheath resembling
in shape a Japanese sword. Their rifles are long and
light, with a narrow well-polished barrel and short
stock. They do not shoulder them in firing, but place
them against the cheek with the fuse rolled round
their arm like a bracelet, and the end of it, which
burns very slowly, lighted. Imperfect as this weapon
is they are very good shots. Our caravan winds in
a long file along a lake surrounded by reeds, in the
middle of which a narrow path has been worn.
Upon the shores of this lake swarm a number of blue
moorhens with red legs, which are easily
domesticated, and which, wdien left near the houses, mount
guard like the geese of the Capitol. Upon reaching
the foot of the hills we have great difficulty in making
the climb through thick underwood in deep mud and
over slippery rocks, the horses, their riders
havingdismounted, being left to themselves, displaying
great agility. The vigorous vegetation intercepts the
light, notably the enormous India-rubber trees loaded
with parasites, the ferns, the lycopodes and the

Bay of Along, the formations of the Dong-Trieu and
the enormous elevations of which we shall see so many
between this and Laos.


So far, our steamer had advanced very slowly,
endeavouring, sometimes without success, to avoid
the sandbanks and frequently compelled to
backwater in order to describe a complete circle. As we
steamed along flocks of wild geese, herons and other
sea-birds rose in clouds above our heads, quite out of
shot, while the canoes were flitting about the river
like a flock of ducks, more than sixty of them
beingcounted by us as they conveyed the household goods
of a village which was miorating en bloc. Further
on, we met several large masts made of timber and
bamboo, and soon after we got into deep water, where
the navigation was much easier.


Despite the savage grandeur of the scenery, we
are not sorry to emerge from this sombre, damp, and
rather sinister passage, and as we round a sharp
curve we find ourselves in the full sunlight, with the
walled rock closing, as it were, behind us. The river,
divided into several arms, extends to the bottom of
a vast basin, shut in up the stream by a chaos of
gray rocks flung anyhow, one upon the other.


While we cast anchor, and the steamer's whistle
announces our arrival, a troop of native soldiers,
carrying the French flag, and commanded by two
civil guards, descend the hill, preceded by a
Frenchman in dress clothes, who is coming to present the
garrison and the chiefs of the country to the Resident.


{empty}M. Vacle, the Government Commissioner, is
wellknown in Tonkin, especially in the highlands, and
his reputation is a very good one, for he has spent

yet this represents only about one half of the Mungtze
trade. In this town we find in 1890 a trade of
1,104,117 taels, or more than £280,000; and in 1891,
1,530,007 taels, or nearly £400,000.


AVe are still far from the figures given by the
custom-houses of North Yunnam and Kouang-Si, and
even from those of the Lao-Kai customs farmed by
the Emperor of Annam before the coming of the
Black Flags.


The trade of Tonkin with China has not reached the
figure which we might hope for. The delays in its
development are due to two causes—mistakes of the
Government, and mistakes of individuals.


{empty}1. Mistakes of the Government:—At the very
outset, even in the treaty with China, the
AngloChinese customs officers, who served as our
gobetweens, took care to introduce a clause, which
we accepted although it was injurious to our trade,
namely the prohibition to export salt from Tonkin to
China. Mr. Bourne, in his report, notes the
disadvantage we suffer from this prohibition. He says :—


\"I think there is no reason to fear any serious
prejudice for English interest in the opening- of the
Red River, as arranged by the recent treaty, even
supposing a hostile tariff at Hong Kong."


Formerly, indeed, Yunnam and a portion of the
neighbouring provinces were provided with sea-salt
from Tonkin, and this was the object of important
commercial exchanges. The inhabitants of these
regions are now reduced to bringing rock salt from
North Yunnam. As the English in India have just
obtained from China the permission to export tea
directly into Thibet (which was formerly done by

loss of a magnificent civet cat, which I shot in a tree,
and which we see instantly fall and disappear in the
earth, without any possibility of recovery. We stop
at Molou, the goal of our excursion. Imagine a circus,
five to six hundred yards in diameter, inclosed by
high gray walls, which, in places, are scarcely hidden
by the brushwood clinging to their sides; at the
bottom of the basin rice fields surround the houses
of the village, which are of Muong construction
placed upon piles, although they are partly inhabited
by Chinese. A kind of inn, inferior, dirty, smelling
of opium, recalling the komkoing of the Celestial
Empire, is reserved for travellers; but in spite of our
interpreter's preference for hotels established by his
fellow countrymen, we prefer another lodging. The
four militiamen who accompany us understand our
thoughts; the cai (corporal), a quick, active,
clearheaded man, who speaks a few words of French,
quickly complies with our unspoken wishes, and leads
us to the dwelling of the chief, where wre meet with
the same hospitality to which we are now accustomed.


It is still daylight, and I do not wish to lose any
time before visiting the gold workings, so while our
men are installing themselves, I express to the
contractor my wish to see the wrorks. He replies that,
unfortunately, we have arrived at an unlucky moment,
for orders have been received from the chief town of
the district that there are to be three days of public
prayer to drive away a disease which rages amongst
the cattle, and this command implies the cessation of
all work. The chief is much embarrassed; he fears
that he shall displease us, yet he is equally anxious
not to irritate his superiors, from whom a messenger

on the breast, the back and even the neck.


At sunset we assist at the religious service of the
priests. The old bonze strikes the gong, letting it
vibrate slowly and softly, and there is something sad
about the ceremony. AVith Europeans, when a gong
is used, it is beaten so as to make the most noise
possible; but we do not know how to produce these
plaintive and sadly eloquent sounds.


After a few short strokes to summon the pupils,
the priest, accompanied by his bonzillons, recites the
prayer in grave and leisurely accents, a deep silence
ensuing.


The natives here seem very peaceful, and we get
on very wrell with them. AVe are looked upon as
important personages, or we should not be admitted
into the sala where we pass the night and which
bears the following inscription :—" Reserved for great
men and mandarins."


There is, however, one point on which w-e and the
people of the village rarely agree. I own it is the
point of chief importance, our food. AVe arrive late
and no one wishes to do business at night. On other
occasions they give as an excuse for having neither
eggs nor chickens, that it is a dry season. One evening
near a village, we are told that there is no water to
drink. In consequence of this surly attitude, caused
chiefly, as I believe, by the presence of our Siamese
soldiers, I am forced to resort to threats. This has a
good effect, but I should be glad to get rid of our
four body guards, as useless as they are troublesome,
obsequious, and of no good whatever in a mess. AVe
should get on much better without them, for their

cannot take, but they can drive back the tigers by
occupying the positions in front of the circle; but I
always saw the latter lose.


In another game two men place themselves face to
face; each raises one hand and suddenly lowers it, at
the same time closing it except one finger. It is a puzzle
game, each player trying to guess which fingers the
other has closed. The victory is won according to
certain rules, which depend upon the meeting of the
thumb and forefinger or of one of the two with the
little finger. The remainder of the party form a circle
round the players; they discuss and criticise the strokes,
laughing and jesting all the time. They are alwTays
equally merry, like happy children.  
  
  
  February 28th.


We pass through more large rocks. I see some
red spots upon several of them, which I mistake for
artificial marks, but the boatmen undeceive me, and
tell me that they are the eggs of an insect.


In the morning, on the left side, we pass the mouth
of the Nam-Ma, which flows into the Black River,
after passing over a large bank of shingles. A great
many cormorants are fishing in it.


The sandbank where we lunch is covered with
butterflies, and our men join Thou in chasing them.


I take a walk through the woods, but it does not
produce much results, though the vegetation is curious,
for I penetrate a real forest of banana trees; some of
them are from seven to eight yards high. We can walk
in the shade beneath them quite comfortably, but all
is silent; animal life seems to have deserted these

its past, but also its future; the great river-courses,
the blue rivers, the River of Pearls, the Song-Cai, the
Mekong; the immense plains of yellow mud which
support nearly 400,000,000 of inhabitants; the crops
which seem to spring up from an inexhaustible soil
needing no manure; the hundreds of miles of villages
huddling one upon the other so closely that they form
but a single street where the traveller cannot find
room even to fix his tent, a people which swarms,
multiplies and toils, and is only too anxious to barter
and to consume.


It is for us to furnish Asia with our science and
intelligence; to be its engineer, its brain. It w-ill
give us in return its labour and its raw material :
coal and metals, rice and wheat, cotton and the ramie
plant.


It is in Asia once again that will be decided the
destinies of the w-orld. In Asia will be founded and
will increase great empires, and whoever succeeds in
making his voice to be heeded in the Far East will be
able also to speak in dominating accents to Europe.


Far-seeing men understood the interest France had
in planting herself upon the flanks of China. They
seized, at the extremity of the old continent, a strip
of land on which they might set up a box for the
French sentinel at the gates of the Celestial Empire.
By a lucky chance this strip of soil was itself rich in
resources. It was at the head of the line leading
directly to the most populous and one of the most
productive empires in the world. By a still happier
coincidence this scrap of land proved to be an
immense storehouse of coal, thus giving our naval forces
the exclusive privilege of complete independence in

In this, as in the other temples are to be found the
conduit for the holy water, the pulpit, the sunshades,
the divinities which lay hands on the faithful, the
adorned gods and the Buddhas with clasped hands
(Pra Hopokoute), while in the adjoining pagoda of
more recent construction are twenty rows of small
gilt Buddhas placed close beside one another against
the wall.


In going back to the market street, we pass the
residence of the Siamese Colonel, the barracks and
the house being built for the members of the English
survey party.


Following the main street eastward, we at last
reach the important temple of Tate Loung (literally,

regards as very poetical, and we leave him to go
and get some food while we are inspecting the
mines.


The country is more hilly and picturesque than
at Hong-Hay, blue mountain torrents tumbling
down through deep ravines, with tall, overhanging
rocks, while on the hills are gnarled trees with
delicate foliage and green glades reminding one of

Japan.


There are two coal-workings in progress, one, about
a mile from the coast, being that of Kebao, while the
other, more than double the distance, is that of
Kaidai. The railway is not yet made, and the coal
is conveyed in barges (which can load 200 tons at
low water) from the pit to the sea. The shaft is
250 feet deep, of which three-fourths were sunk in
six months, with a diameter of 13 feet. All the
workmen employed here are Chinese, and they are
paid at the rate of 50 piastres for each metre sunk,

including the timber for lining the sides. The timber
o o

is kept in its place by means of iron clamps, and the
stonework and masonry will follow.


The cable which raises the connecting rods rests
upon transversal iron beams upon two brick pillars,
aud it is worked by steam. There are not more than
seven cubic feet of water per hour in the bottom of
the mine. Beyond the shaft, there is an inclined
plane, about 660 feet long (or a third of that
depth), and two seams are being worked, one
about 40 inches thick, the other nearly double. A
building is being erected for the machinery above
the shaft, the brick and lime being made at Kebao,

Muongs,1 who do not belong specially to any one,
these races being generally under the feudal regime.
Annamites and Muongs meet at the market of
ChoBo, the former having, like their neighbours the
Chinese, much greater commercial aptitude than
the latter, who, apart from the produce of their fields
and of the chase, merely sell a few inferior iron
implements, or horses. The people of the Delta,
moreover, affect the utmost contempt for the inhabitants
of the highlands, the most important Muong chief
being regarded by my "boys" as scarcely worthy of
being spoken to, and I find myself constantly being
compelled to call them to order in this respect.


{empty}M. Vacle is most anxious to give us all the
information he can about the natives, with whom he is so
well acquainted, but ethnography is not the only
science which might be enriched by new facts at
Cho-Bo, and there is a fine field there for the lover of
natural history. Without leaving the post-house, I
notice a cage filled with small monkeys of what is
known as the sleeping- variety. Hanging from the
bars of the cage, rolled up like balls, they have a
very singular appearance, especially when they have
been woke up and look with a scared air out of
their big round eyes. Despite their small
proportions, their skin is valued in the country as being
worth at least fifteen piastres, because the hairs, as we
are told, serve to heal wrounds, and it is curious to
find a similar belief being prevalent among the negroes
of the Gaboon. We are told, too, of a maned
antelope to be found among the rocks, which, I take
it, is none other than the Nemorrhœdus.

The jetty projects nearly a hundred feet into the
sea, and, instead of experimenting with the Tonkin
timber, tbe large piles upon which it is founded have
been brought from Borneo at a cost of £12,000. In
the course of time this jetty will form a letter T\ the
two branches being in twenty feet of water at low
tide.


There are four lines of rail, each a metre broad,
upon the quay, the sleepers being of steel as in Bengal.
These sleepers, each of which costs five shillings, are
purchased in England, where there are large
quantities of them in stock. The train is made up of
trucks with two movable compartments, each
holdingfour tons. Two locomotives are in use; and two
cranes, which can load 1,600 tons a day, are
beingconstructed for loading and unloading the trucks.
O O


Before reaching the jetty, the trucks from Nagotna
and Hatou will be emptied on to a sifter, or iron sheet
with holes about an inch in diameter, in order to get
rid of the dust, and the principle adopted at
HongHay is not to employ elevators, but to utilise the laws
of gravity for getting the work done. The sifter, which
will be at Hong-Hay itself, is not yet constructed, and
it will be of little use for another six months, when
the Hatou railway may have been completed.


We are taken to the workshops immediately upon
our arrival, the one being devoted to the
manipulation of iron, the other to that of wood, while in
the centre is an office from which the work can be
supervised. The workmen employed are Chinese, and
their wages vary from five to six and sixpence a day,

and though the Annamites stand in need of a few
lessons from us, they are very quick to learn, and

improve every year.


In addition to the silk industry, M.
BourgoingMeiffre has a portion of the military contracts, and he
supplies clothing to the sharpshooters. A contract was
also concluded between him and a chief in the higher
region of the country for the supply of tea, and he
likewise trades in cotton. Having come over to
France after getting together a small capital for this
purpose, he encountered such difficulties in the
purchase of the working material and the engagement of
skilled workmen that he was obliged to go to England,
where he at once got what he wanted. The capital,
supplied half by him and half by a few large cotton
spinners, amounted to about £34,000, and it was
agreed that the enterprise should begin with 10,000
spindles. He might have been willing to pay £2,000
more in France than he had to do in England for
the machinery, if the vendor had been willing to
make reasonable conditions, but he refused to deliver
it in Tonkin or to send any men out with it.


How different was the attitude of a Manchester
house which has already supplied one of our large
cotton-factories in France with spindles. This firm,
which contracted to supply what was wTanted for
£24,000, sent out to Hanoi at its own cost a
constructor with the iron framework, and then the
material itself, accompanied by three head workmen,
who are to remain in Tonkin as long as they are
required to initiate the natives into the work. A
third of the sum was to be paid upon the signature

a fireplace formed of stones held in position by woven
mats a few logs are throwing a feeble light over the
scene. A young girl is seated, a scarf of orange silk
knotted upon one shoulder, cleaning cotton by
separating it from the seed by hand. Near her stands one of
our boatmen, in a small white cloth jacket ornamented
withEuropean copper buttons,he is paying compliments
to her. Holding one of her hands, he takes out the
flowers she has placed in her hair, and passes them
through the lobe of his ear. Further on, upon the
terrace of a house, another young girl is talking to her
lover; a small lamp gives them light, and they are
playing at dinner or preparing betel for each other. They
will, perhaps, chat together every night, in this way,
for several months, simply exchanging ideas before
coming to a definite understanding—a marriage
generally follows. In the square, a man is holding
one of the Laotian bamboo instruments that resemble
an organ; this one is two yards long, and the artist
produces from it sweet solemn notes, which mingle
with some faint songs. The listeners accompany the
music by striking one hand against the palm of the
other; instead of following the rhythm in three time
used in Central Asia and amongst the Mussulmans, the
clapping here continues uniformly and regularly. It
is more monotonous.


Every one is quiet, there is no noise, no cries, no
dances, but the stars seem more brilliant than ever;
the air is scented; one feels happy in living, and if
it were not necessary to leave so early to-morrow

from news, far from cities, far from civilisation, at
the foot of the cocoa-trees in the valley of Nam Ou.

had at one time hoped to be backed up by our arms,
foresaw the policy of non-intervention and excessive
prudence which would be impressed upon our officers.
He recognised that the valiant champions of our
colonial extension would have their hands tied and
that it would be no use reckoning upon us. ' The
Siamese are coming up," he said to Dr. Neis; " we are
lost."


As a matter of fact, while we were standing still,
the Siamese were advancing, and it is easy to
understand the political course followed by the Court of
Bangkok; as long as it is left free, it is always
marching forward, occupying advance posts, sometimes with
only seven or eight militia men, but still making a
reality of its occupation. But for Colonel Pennequin,
Theng would have fared no better than all the
important centres upon the Mekong as far as Cambodia
and than several towns between the coast and the
river; one can feel that these Siamese troops, when
they are on the march, have behind them the moral
if not the effective support of intelligent and fearless
persons, who are used to getting their way by firm
speaking, the only obstacles which they are likely to
encounter from European nations being idle diplomatic
protests.


As soon as they have established themselves
anywhere, the Siamese at once endeavour to combat
rival influences, winning over allies underhand and
terrorizing those who, seeing no other chance of
succour, are compelled to accept their friendship.
In 1872 they entered upon the district of Traninh
and depopulated part of it, while from Luang Prabang
they sent agents on to our territory in the region of

\"Arimasen" (there are none), you would reply with
a smile. You do not regret your own country, for you
carry it with you, and in the recesses of the Muong
hut you certainly have placed a portrait of
FousiYama, surrounded by a few flowers which are lighted
up for you by the sun of Tokio. The irrigation is
very well carried out in the fields; numerous small
canals have been cut, these canals being regularly
filled with water by a sort of long wooden spoon
which moves on a pivot and is set automatically in
motion by the weight of the water. A native woman
suffering from some complaint is being douched
without taking any notice of the passers by, but as soon
as she sees me she takes to flight. In the course of
the afternoon the hills we pass are more steep, and
are succeeded by chalk cliffs rising to a height of
300 feet. In some places they overhang the route,
forming a projection, or else stalactites covered with
moss as with a green carpet. In the hollows may be
seen small palm trees glistening with moisture and
stretching out their green arms over us as if to salute
us on our way. The channel must be pretty deep, for
the water is smooth, and in many places very dark,
the crests of the cliffs on each side not being more
than 150 feet apart. We come upon several more of

these long and deep passages similar to those we saw
before reaching Cho-bo. They appear to have been

was changing her shell, the male kept guard at the
entrance to the hole; the female then comes out,
makes a sign to another male crab and ' carries
on with him.' A fisherman, having noticed this,
related it to the king, and the latter determined to
ascertain whether it is the same with humanity, and
whether the men are better than the women. He
accordingly published an edict promising a large reward
to any man who would kill his wife. One husband
accepted the proposal, being assured of impunity.
But upon going home he found his wife and children
in tears, and sooner than put the former to death he
delivered himself up to the king, who had him cast
into prison.


\"A fresh edict was then issued in favour of wives
against husbands. One wife undertakes to kill her
husband, has him decapitated and his head brought
to the court. The king then sees that women are
worse than men, has her head cut off and gives a
handsome reward to the husband who has been cast
into prison."


This native story kept us up rather late, and the
silence around the camp is broken by the hoarse
roaring of the big stags which come down to drink;
upon several crests of the hills fires are lighted,
while others are seen in the valley, and w?e wonder
whether these can be the signals used by the pirates
to correspond with one another.

A staircase about twenty yards high leads to it; on
the right a ruined house which leans against the rock
is occasionally used as a lodging by some priests;
red devils with large heads, armed with sabres, are
carved on both sides of the entrance. The first hall is
spacious; it is fifteen yards high, and the natural
irregularities have been respected and even turned
to account; the walls are decorated with green moss,
and the ceiling is made of large stalactites joined and
rounded. Upon the ground, upon the steps, upon
isolated stones and in the hollows, everywhere, in the
midst of the greatest disorder, a people of gods of
every shape and every size has found a home.
Statuettes from one yard high, to one or two inches,
of black or gilt wood, of marble, bronze, or copper;
gods standing with their hands raised as though in
benediction; stout Buddhas, with bare heads,
squatting down, their arms folded across their stomach,
their shoulders often covered with a piece of stuff
arranged like a cape; bonzes, saints, prophets and
their servants, showing the same type as the idols of
Siam. The whole Buddhist Olympia is united here,
and when the idols are carefully examined, one believes
that traces may be found amongst them of all
religions and of all nations; here something from Greece,
there a reminiscence of Egyptian art, while further on
a marble head ornamented by a raised diadem, reminds
one of the Khiner monuments. All these gods lie
about everywhere, turned in every direction, hidden or
fallen, often covered with dust; there is not a corner
without its deity, and niches are often cut by the hand
of man and ornamented with carvings of gilded wood,
to shelter an exceptionally venerated saint. Even

'ias much detail as possible, taking notes and
photographs, while later in the afternoon we went out on
horseback to the suburbs. In this way, time went all
too quickly, as there is so much to be seen here. No
sooner had we got back than we were overrun by a
troop of female hawkers, who settled themselves down
in our quarters and spread out their wares for sale.
These women all w-ear the same sort of dress, namely
a silk petticoat with a scarf to match, some of them
having their hair cropped close after the Siamese
fashion, which is a very ugly one. After a few days
we get quite familiar and call these young ladies
by their proper names. They either have some
name which indicates their sex, followed by the
qualification of small, pretty, or what not; or else
they bear the name of some good quality, such as
peace, happiness, prosperity, jewel. The same
saleswomen came back every clay, asking an exorbitant
juice for every article and not showing any inclination
to rebate it. However, they are very good-natured
in the bargaining which follows, and seem as well
pleased if they do not effect a sale as wdien, after a
long discussion, we end by making a purchase. They
have a very diversified stock of goods to choose from,
including gold embroidered shirts made by the Lus,
Siam brocaded vests, old silver, bracelets made of Kas
bronze, and hatchets and other weapons in old bronze;
these latter are very scarce and difficult to buy, as
they are preserved with superstitious reverence by
the families to which they belong. The hatchets, some
of which are straight while others are curved, are
very characteristic, while the ivory-handled knives
represent yaks, the genii of the Buddhist relioion

and banana leaves, and his pirogue is moored before it.
He has two European flint guns, and his provisions are
placed in small baskets of plaited bamboos. He fishes
with cast-nets garnished with plates of lead and with
bottom lines; the fishhooks are coarse and badly

pointed.

Further on the banks draw closer together, and we

enter a long defile with very high calcareous walls,
similar to the one which we passed through before
Van Yen; in the evening we camp upon a little sand
bank. Some natives returning from Nam-Ma stop
near us; they have been selling eggs, chickens, and
ducks, but have only a goat left, which they offer us
for four piastres, but we have no use for it.


It is too late to attempt any shooting. To the
boys' astonishment I seat myself near the boatmen
who at once make room for me on the side
where I shall not feel the smoke from their fires
To their usual bill of fare they have added the
tender leaves of a small shrub called Pac-neu,
which, they say, is both a good seasoning and an
excellentjremedy for pains in the stomach.
Havingended their meal, they amuse themselves by
organizing games. The preparations are very simple; the
sand serves for a table, a rectangle is traced and divided
into small squares. This is the camp; on the two
sides circles are drawn representing the mountain; in
the centre of them, in A and in B, a pin of curved
bamboo represents a tiger; twenty-two small pins
all round the rectangle are the pigs. Pigs and tigers
have the right to move backwards or forwards, from
one intersection to the other; the tigers can take one
of their adversaries by jumping certain lines; the pigs

forty the hundred tens; the latter quantity is paid
for by about one ten and a half of gold.


But the Chinese take advantage of the simplicity
of the Muongs to, at first, provide them with a little
more goods than they can pay for; they then make
advances to them, at a fabulous rate of interest, so
that the unfortunate natives are never able to pay
off their debt, and necessarily the whole produce of
their labour, until they die, goes to fill the coffers of
some merchant of the Celestial Empire. And here I
notice the same racial peculiarity that I have already
seen in a great portion of Asia, in Turkestan, in
Thibet, and in the Malay Peninsula. The Chinese,
wherever they can insinuate themselves in the old
continent, play the part of the Jews in Europe.
Mahommedans, Turks, Thibetans, natives of the banks
of Mekong, from Saigon to Batang, are oppressed,
deceived, exploited by the one as the Russian
peasants were by the others. Everywhere the simple
are crushed by the skilful; the earthen pot vainly
struggles against the iron one. When will the
meeting of the two brothers take place, the Semite
of the West come in contact with the Semite of the
East ?


Will a collision follow ? Will the wolves devour
each other ? The future alone can solve this question.
Until now they have left each other a free field; one
nation has turned to the right the other to the left.
This is perhaps the best explanation of a phenomenon
which has puzzled a great many ethnographers, the
almost complete absence of the Jewish element from
one-half of the ancient world. The half-breed
<!-- Leaf 119, Page: 103 -->
conresolved to use my passport as rarely as possible.
{empty}M. Guillaume, a clerk in the telegraph department,
whom I met at Hanoi, told me that while he was
surveying for aline to Luang-Praboang, he met with
all kinds of difficulties from the people of Siam,
despite, or perhaps because of, the passport with which
he was provided. For my own part, I have already
had occasion in China to see what little value Oriental
people, even those who are by way of being the most
civilized, attach to official documents and papers of
identification. In packing up all these miscellaneous
objects, we have endeavoured to distribute them all
in such a way that if we lose any of our luggage
we may not be deprived altogether of any one thing.


Our party comprises three Annamites : Sao, a good
shot, according to his own account, and knowing how
to stuff birds; Thou, who claims to be an expert in
most things and who has already been through the
Laos country with Mr. Macey; and Baptiste, who is
to do the cooking.


We shall know more about them later on, and the
knowledge will be gained at our own expense, but, to
start with, they agree to all our proposals, making.
however, certain mental reserves. They must,
however, think that I am a little off my head when I tell
them that they will all of them have to put their
hands to anything and that I do not intend them
to take advantage of the principle of "division of
labour," to let one of them stand idle while the others
are hard at work.


I have not yet an interpreter, but have been
promised one at Cho-Bo, for although in the Delta
almost any servant can act as interpreter, this is not

They say that they do not know anything of their
history, but add : that the Laotians are their brothers,
therefore the Kas had compassion upon them and
retired to the mountains, leaving the plain and the
young shoots of bamboo to them.


Marriages are easily made amongst the Khamouks;
the young man's parents give sixty rupees to the
girl's father and mother. After the marriage feast, the
bridegroom sleeps one night in his father-in-law's
house, then takes his wife home with him.


The dead are buried and not burnt; there is no
priest, no religious ceremonies, but the master of the
house cuts a fowl's throat and the mourners rub their
knees with his blood. The men generally follow one
stage in the bonzeries.1 After a few months they are
little bonze or Siang, then grand bonze or Tit; a man
who has not made one stage is Ba.


I do not know whether our boatmen have followed
any religious courses, but they do not seem to trouble
themselves about the future. One of them first tells
me that he does not know what will happen in the
other life; then he adds that he believes he shall
return to this world as a man, if he shows mercy
during his lifetime, that is if he gives rice to the doo-s
and cats, or performs any other charitable actions; if
not his soul will pass into the body of an animal.


1 I question whether this information does not apply more to
the Laotians.

This post, which on the maps is called Dien Bien
Fou1 (an Annamite denomination), ds of more
importance from a political and administrative than
from a strategic point of view. The officer in
command fills chiefly the office of administrator; in fact,
{empty}M. Gassouin is quan chau with two caituongs under
him. Deo Van Tri is not liked by the inhabitants;
and his authority has been set aside, but the Siamese
influence is felt even here. Some of the quan chau
placed at our disposal have taken the oath in the
neighbouring territory, and the commanding officer
has less power of enforcing his authority, because it
is limited by superior orders. For instance, he must
send an escort with the convoys, which go to Sop
Nao (the first Siamese post), but he has not the right
of accompanying* them himself; he is obliged to ask
the Siamese officer, who is allowed more freedom of
action, to come to Dien Bien Fou to arrange about
the routes. Under these conditions he encounters
great difficulties in governing as he wishes; his sole
resource is to take advantage of the divisions and
rivalries between the various chiefs. The subsidies
are inadequate for the payment of the different
services, and the only way to fill up the empty
treasury is resorting to fines; one pig for two stolen
cabbages, and two piculs of rice for a fire lighted too
near the post without permission.


The fines are converted into money from time to
time and they supply the necessary sum from which


1 Formerly the region was divided into two chaus—Muong
Theng and Ninh Bien (now called Sop Cop). It is perhaps from
the union of the two names, and an alteration of the former
that the appellation of Dien Bien Fou has been obtaind.

between their legends and the tales of the Thibetans,
the hare, for instance, being made by each to
personify cunning, as the fox does in our own fables.


There are white as well as black Thais on the
Black River, the former inhabiting mostly the upper
region from Van Bou to the frontiers of China, while
the latter are to be met with chiefly lower clown.
There are but slight differences in the dress, the
patois and the writing, and though our interpreter
asserts that he cannot read the manuscripts of the
black Thais, he is so lazy that I do not know whether
to believe him or not.


The Thais have in some instances intermarried
with the native races, and, apart from ethnographical
characteristics, this facility of assimilation
distinguishes them very clearly from the Annamites,
who are much prouder and less easy to mould; for
Annamite colonies founded sixty years ago upon the
Mekong have not borrowed anything from their
neighbours of the Laos, but have always remained
the same, whereas the Chinese, on the contrary, who
are settled in Tonkin adapt themselves to the
contact of the dominating race.


The Thais are under a mild system of rule, which
includes three administrative unities, commencing by
som (hamlet) and going up to the sa (village) and to
the chau (canton).


Every year, the assembly of notables in the hamlet
allots the land suitable for cultivation among the
inhabitants, so much to each one, according to
the means of which he can dispose, the number of
hands he can utilize, and the number of buffaloes
which he owns. If any dispute arises, it is referred

1 It is impossible to estimate the importance of the Tonkin
coal-fields, as it is not known where they begin, and where they
end. The strata no doubt traverse the whole country; for,
having been discovered in the island of Hai'nam, and worked at
Kebao and Hong-Hay, as well as at several places in the
DongTrieu, they appear again at the upper part of the Bed River,
where seams were discovered between Yfen-Bai and Lao-Kai.
Several pits were opened there, and the coal taken from them
and used in war-ships gave great satisfaction, for, though only
surface coal, it is lighted easily and burns well. These seams
running parallel with the upper reaches of the river may have a
great future before them, as they secure a freight for the junks
going up with goods, while they will facilitate steam navigation
by obviating the necessity for artificial coal depots. The cotton
trade may also be benefited by it, as spinning factories would
have abundance of combustible ready to hand. It is difficult to
speak with much assurance, but I thought it well to mention the
recent discovery and point out some of the advantages which
might be derived from it, because, let me repeat, coal is one
of the essential conditions of the industrial development of
Tonkin.

by a crown or cap of greenery. The sea is calm, its
surface scarcely wrinkled by the furrows which our sloop
makes, and in colour it is of a deep mysterious blue,
which seems, as it were, to conceal immeasurable
depths. It would seem, indeed, as if the waters,
formerly much higher, had receded after having eaten
into the cliffs, for in many places there are large
recesses and the summit overhangs, while in others
the rock, instead of having any vegetation, runs
to a point like a long blade bristling with needles.
In all directions, there are small creeks and natural
caverns to which only a small boat can penetrate
through a natural archway. The two
prevailingelements of grandeur, which add to the majesty of
the scene, are solitude and calm. As the sloop
advances the route seems to close in behind us, and
we may well wonder how we entered this new,
unknown and mysterious kingdom. We are in a land
of dreams, where the imagination allows itself free
course, and it is easy to conjure up pirates and
corsairs coming into the recesses of some creek, the
access to which is known to them alone, in order to
count their spoils. One fancies them dominated by a
woman—young, very beautiful, and rather pensive.
A deep passion, a struggle between the two rivals,
treason, followed by the punishment of the traitor,
and then the happiness of the woman disappearing
into the terrible archipelago. These are the fancies
which course through my brain, and, mixed up with
all this, tremendous encounters, flights through
grottos with a double issue half full of water, and other
daydreams, until my companions hail to me that we
have reached our destination.

of paradise which he hopes to regain, and be tells
us that he has left part of his heart behind him
there.


Sac is quite a different type. Tall, thin, and angular
of countenance, he is not at all communicative; he does
his allotted work very well, but at times he is not so
easy to manage as his comrade, for, having hitherto
led an untrammeled life in the delta, keeping himself
with the produce of the chase, he cannot readily bend
himself to discipline, and we endeavour, as far as
possible, to fall in with the independence of his
disposition. Despite his obstinacy, I am pleased to have
engaged him, for he is a capital man to have with us
on the road, being both full of courage and adept at
getting one out of a difficulty. Sao is a native of the
Vinh, so Thou, who is from the basin of the Red River,
will not admit that he is an Annamite.


As to Baptiste, he is a good cook, but we do not like
his underhand looks, and, being nearly always in a
stupefied state from the effects ofthe opium wdiich he
smokes in secret, he excites very little sympathy; he
is so negligent and lazy that we are constantly obliged
to reprimand him, and if he does not mind what he
is about we shall have to get rid of him.


The Chinese interpreter will, perhaps, do, though
he, too, is an opium smoker. But he will not mix
with the men or attempt to inform himself and take
an interest in our voyage. We always have to
keep on asking him the same questions, and, as he
has no initiative, we can only regard him as a
pis-aller.
<!-- Leaf 246, Page: 230 -->
hunters were killed by one of these animals. The
rhinoceros is becoming rarer; five or six years ago
some of them were killed within a few miles of Lai.
Deer, tigers, small-sized felines, large civet cats,
with ringed tails, and monkeys are found in great
abundance; amongst the latter are found the large
gibbons with extraordinarily long arms. A native
has given me the skin of a reddish-brown gibbon,
marked with a stripe upon the head. The species
seemed new at the Museum, but unfortunately I have
only a flat skin, without a skull and with two paws
missing. A great many peacocks, silver pheasants,
and bee-eaters are killed for their plumage, and the
large buceros for their extraordinary beaks, they
utter the most discordant cries. As a rule, the
members of Deo Van Tri's family hunt all day long,
and fire at everything that comes within range;
consequently they are often short of ammunition, and
our visit has been a windfall for them, for I have
distributed several boxes of powder amongst them on
condition that they bring us their booty.


As regards variety, the flora has nothing to
envy the fauna, for the forests contain the most
diversified species. Some of them may be utilized
when the means of communication have improved and
the spirit of enterprise has provided some capital even
in the higher districts. Deo Van Tri assures me that
teak grows opposite Lai, here it is called tiet-tao;
benjamin is missing, cardamom is rare, but cunao is
very common and is sent to Hanoi, but I am told
that the trade in these tubercles is not very
profitable.  
  
  
  It is the same with the mines as with the woods;

One looks back with regret towards the tranquil
and indifferent Thais of the up country. The
Chinese keep shops of European goods in those large
house-boats, bound one to the other, of which the
monotonous Menam towns are for the most part
constructed. At Pitchai I make a list of the trifles
in one of these boats; namely bottles of olive
oil, sweets, drugs, buttonhooks, pipes, scent bottles,
bottles of rose-water, straw hats, tin boxes with panels
representing episodes of the w-ar of 1870 and France
furnishing some new provinces to Germany, cloth, stuffs
and small white waistcoats, watch chains, fobs, filters,
glasses, umbrellas, saws, wooden cruets, kerosene
lamps, cords, gimlets, mats and iron instruments, all
German or English, nothing French. The
shopkeeper tells me that he sells in six months sixty
tchangs' (eighty ticals) worth of goods, or about
£650 worth a year. AVhen I ask him why he
does not buy French objects he replies : " They are
of good quality, but not so cheap as English or
German."


Indeed, French commerce on the Menam is
practically nil. One is glad to perceive a tricoloured
flagoccasionally, but I would prefer for my part a little
less flag and a little more trade, of which there is none
at all, or very little. A French bank established at
Pa Nam Po was closed two years ago, and even in
Banokok I see only one French shop, provided
especially with scents, toilet objects and articles de
Paris. Whereas there is an almost daily service of
fairly large steamers between Bangkok and Singapore,
the capital of Siam communicates with Siam only

periods, this fish ascends the river as far as the
confluent of the Nam Ou, and its capture is a source
of great profit for the inhabitants, as its eggs (which
make excellent caviar when fresh) are sent as far as
Xieng Mai, while the fish itself is canned and isinglass
is obtained from its skin.


AVhen we land on the left bank, we notice a number
of people stooping down, with their feet in the water,
engaged in washing out the sand; these are gold
finders, who earn but a scanty living, though they
sometimes come upon an old coin or two which has
been washed clown stream. A climb of about fifty
feet up decrepit steps, which iu summer are under
water, brings us to the town. Close upon the left is
a small pagoda, Ouate Po une Sal, which is only
remarkable for the fresco above the entrance gate,
this representing Kop, the sun, eating the moon; in
other words, the fresco is intended to designate an
eclipse.


In front of us is a broad avenue, lined with fine
trees, which is perpendicular to the river, and is
intersected at a distance of a hundred yards or so by a
road which runs parallel to the Mekong. This is the
main street of Luang Prabang, upon the two sides of
which the market is held morning and evening. The
animation is greatest in the morning, when, for a
distance of more than half a mile, there is a long row
of small booths, some of which are rather lofty, and
are surmounted by a roof of bamboos, while others
are very close to the ground. These booths are the
rendezvous of the whole population, of the bourgeoisie,
of the mountaineers, of the bonzes, of the working
classes, and ofthe villagers. It is a strange crowd,
<!-- Leaf 291, Page: 275 -->
wooded hills, which appear full of game. I shoot
some long-tailed black monkeys (gibbons), and wound
a peacock, which I am unable to find.


In the evening some natives come and beg us not
to enter the village near which we have halted, for a
man has died there, and the funeral is being celebrated
by a great feast, at which a good deal of tchoum
tchourn will be drunk; our presence would be a
constraint upon the guests.


AVe remain at the sala placed outside, and our
boatmen assemble round us. I talk to them, and
they tell me that they are engaged upon the pirogues
for the benefit of the owner (usually a Laotian), who
stands at the helm. To them a boat represents a large
capital; the one in which I travel is worth
sixtyseven rupees. As a rule the owner trades with them,
a pirogue can carry about thirty-six thengs (a theng
weighs about thirty-four pounds). The boatmen are
chiefly hired from among the Kas; they are of small
size, with very dark complexions and narrow
foreheads; their eyes are close together, but the
cheekbones are not prominent; they wear their hair very
short like the bristles of a brush. They are easily
recognised as Laotians, but they appear inferior and
weaker, though they are lively and prepossessing;
they originally came from Ban Lasa (near Muong
Ngoi), but they call themselves Khamouks, and count
seven principal tribes of Kas; but their dialects differ,
so that several of them cannot understand each other.

least hampered by the children they carry on their
backs, are armed with poles by means of which they
endeavour to keep the boats clear of one another,
interlarding their efforts with the most violent
imprecations.


Amid all this hubbub we are landed by the steam
launch at the hotel. Our force is at present very
small, consisting solely of Charles and myself. The
former, as I have already explained in the account of
my travels in India, is a most valuable companion, a
good judge of what is worth collecting, very zealous,
and easily satisfied. He will, as I anticipate, be of
great service to me in my travels.


I have no sooner arrived at Hong-Kong than I
begin to think when I shall get away, this being
my third visit to the English town, and, but for our
having encountered heavy weather just before reaching
Cape St. James, I should have travelled by another
line of steamers which follows the coast of Annam
from Saigon to Haiphong. The prospect of a long
voyage in bad weather and on a small steamer deterred
me, although by way of Hong-Kong we shall not
reach Tonkin any sooner; the only difference is that
we have three days less at sea, so I determine to
utilise them by making an excursion to Canton.


Two navigation companies, one English, the other
Chinese, run steamers from Hong-Kong to Canton and
back. These steamers, which are large river-boats of
the American type, with several decks, start every
day, and their chief source of profit is derived from
the goods which they carry and from the native
passengers who are crowded into the lower decks  
  
  
  at the rate of five cents a head. Some of the
<!-- Leaf 260, Page: 244 -->
the highest can be scarcely fifty yards. From a
distance these great molehills hardly appear above the
general level, and they do not spoil the harmony of
the scene in any way, but when we get nearer some
of them have peculiarities which strike the traveller,
and first of all, at the summit of one of these
mounds, half hidden amongst the high grass, we find
a series of bronze statues. This is the first trace of
the Buddhist religion that we have seen since we left
Hanoi, and travelled westwards, for the figures are of
Buddha, eight in number, and not more than a yard
high. They are surrounded by bricks which, with the
fragments of a staircase, point to the remains of a
pagoda. This is probably the work of the Siamese
or of the Laotians of Mekong; the gods all have (or
rather had, for they appear much neglected) the same
position. Their lai'ge faces, which are somewhat
Assyrian, with curved noses, well-marked eyebrows,
and thick lips, ironically compressed, are identical
with those we found upon all the altars of Laos.
The headdress forms little points, surmounted by a
higher one, on the top of the head; the legs are
crossed. On the feet a star or a Greek cross has been
drawn in a circle while a cord forms a shoulder belt.
The statues were formerly gilt, and, judging from the
ashes which I find, perfumes were probably burnt
inside them. At present the divinities are abandoned;
no homage is paid to them, their limbs are falling off in
the wind and rain, and I replace the heads upon several
of them. Turned to the east, impassive, always in the
same position, the Buddhas continue to watch the
sunrise until a more religious people conies to extricate
them from their neglected condition, to regild them

embroidered belt coming up to the throat, while the
breasts, generally bare, are occasionally concealed by
a small, short tunic. They very soon go off to the
other end of the house, while we are soon fast
asleep.  
  
  
  January llth.


We continue our march over the same plateau,
where the uncultivated spaces alternate with
ricefields, overhung here and there by blocks of chalk.
The route, which has been recently widened, is not
sufficiently trodden at all places, and, notwithstanding
the bamboo hurdles laid down on the surface, our
horses sink up to their chests. Several chiefs come
out to meet us, and their pale faces, with a few
stray hairs, are rather frank and open, and their
teeth are blackened over. They always wear the
same kind of dress, consisting of a violet robe, and
loose trousers of white linen. Their soldiers follow
them, several of these carrying their rifles reversed
in sign of subjection.


Every time we pass through a village we have
to stop at the house of the quamlong, and take the
tea served us in very tiny cups. Before this, he
makes a series of salutes, bowing several
times, with folded hands, to the ground, and
offering us eggs and bananas, this being meant to
indicate at once his vassaldom as well as his desire
to be agreeable to us. We can no more refuse to
accept the present than he can to offer it, these
being two obligations which cannot be omitted
without bringing disrepute upon himself. Quids of
rolled betel nut are offered at the same time as the
<!-- Leaf 414, Page: 398 -->
being already ten times as many as there were before
{empty}M. Pavie's trip. The local trade will develop when
the higher lands begin to be opened up. The Black
River will thus catch a small part of the commerce
of Laos and some products (including- tea) of the
province of Puerh. But I do not feel warranted in
supposing that the future here will be different from
the past, or that the Black River will ever have an
importance approaching that of the Red River.


Before speaking of the Red River I should like to
quote the opinions of the authors who have studied
the question, from Francis Gamier, the Dupuis,
and their successors clown to the German Richtofen,
the English Hosie, Little, Bourne, Hallett, and the
Anglo-Chinese Mesny. They are almost unanimous in
praise of the great highway for trade utilized by the
Chinese agents—a highway which is now French.
Formerly, there were only results to show in support
of this, but these, it is true, were sufficiently
convincing. Before the coming of the Black Flags the
Lao Kay Custom House contributed to Annam
£178,320.


Now we have more than mere deductions, for the
navigability of the Red River, which, as Doctor
Pichon notes,1 is of the highest interest to the future
of Tonkin, has been minutely studied.


There are reports by Lieutenant Le Prieur, by
Commandant Bugard, by Lieutenant Lapied,
byEngineer Getten for the State, and by engineers of
the Messagerics Fhiviales de Tonkin on behalf of
private enterprise. But one fact, which has, more
than volumes of writing, strikingly and definitely  
  
  
  1 Un Voyage au Yunnam, par le Dr. Louis Pichon (Plon).
<!-- Leaf 181, Page: 165 -->
a large copper dish from Lao Kay is used for
preparing the pigs' food. These animals are numerous
here, and are of quite a different breed from those of
Tonkin. Bunches of maize aud millet hang from
the ceiling. I also notice some rice, and in some
tubs are grains of maize and a plant known as
\"Job's tears," from which they make a bad brandy.
The Meos use a very simple loom for weaving the
flax they cultivate. They make paper from rice
straw, and work iron with a primitive forge, made
of the hollow trunk of a tree closed with cement,
while two skins moved by a piston replace the
bellows. Near the house, granaries for the maize are
raised upon four posts to secure them from animals;
tobacco leaves arc drying upon cords; the gardens
are well kept and surrounded with small palings.
They contain some fruit trees—including the peach
and tangerine.


They are more industrious than the Muongs, and
make pails of hooped wood, which are carried by a
kind of hook placed upon an extension of one of the
pieces; they also have trowels, spades, and hoes.


The maize is ground in a mill formed of three
stones, the centre one being pierced through its axis
by a hole, through which the grain passes, and it
turns by means of a wooden eccentric, which merely
requires pushing or pulling.


For weapons they have guns with still shorter
buts and longer barrels than those carried by the
Thais; they also use bows with triggers, a kind of
cross-bow. They show me how snares are spread for
large animals by means of two bows laid horizontally
upon bamboos, the one serving to discharge the
<!-- Leaf 232, Page: 216 -->
horses. They belong to a caravan from Yunnan,
which has brought some sugar and cotton goods; it
will return laden with raw cotton. The inn is dirty
and full of Chinese half asleep from the fumes of
opium; to the stupefaction of the coolies and boys, I
declare that I prefer passing the night in the open air.
In five minutes the luggage is arranged in a
horseshoe, a shelter is established, a fire lighted, a piece
of bacon, a few eggs, and some water, will make an
excellent dinner, and we shall sleep with the sky as
our roof, happier and quieter than kings.


The night has been fresh; we have had a minimum
of forty degrees. The climate is temperate, and I
notice some European plants that I have not seen
lower clown—some iris and wild roses. The
inhabitants tell me that the country is healthy, and there
are few illnesses. In summer they have the same
temperature here as Laichau has in winter; maize,
cotton, and wheat grow well. If the tableland were
more accessible, if only Lao Kay were connected with
it by a regular line of steamers or by a railway, what
an admirable sanatorium could be made here for our
troops and exhausted officials ! AVe have in Tonkin,
at a lower level, the equivalent of the English
health resorts of Simla or Darjeling, but at present
the only inhabitants of these high plains are
Yunnanaise tribes scattered in small villages of three
or four huts. AA7e visit some families of Yaos,
about a quarter of an hour's walk from our
encampment; they occupy four villages, which bear the same
name as the whole of the plateau, Tafine. The houses
are built of planks erected upon the ground and the
horses are shut up in a kind of raised cage provided
<!-- Leaf 290, Page: 274 -->
animals are represented; in one rock two elephants
are cut out and dyed green, each carrying a
personage. In another corner stands a white elephant, one
of the incarnations of Buddha. The body, which is
about a yard and a half high, is made of wood and
stuff, and the whole is covered with calico. Some
small earthen cones, surmounted by a stick, are
arranged in front of the sacred animal, forming a
miniature garden with a tiny staircase. I believe
they represent something analogous to our ex-votos.
If I can believe the interpreter's explanations, these
earthen cakes are placed here by people who have
been ill and wish to thank heaven for preserving their
life; the number of the cones corresponds with their
age. The entrance hall, which at the first glance
resembles an old curiosity shop, is lighted from the
outside; it leads to other galleries, which we explored
with a lantern. Corridor succeeds corridor, it seems
as though the grotto were endless, and it must really
extend for a great distance. Legend relates that it
communicates with Lai Chou. Sometimes the
passages are so narrow that we are forced to crawl
through them, sometimes the rooms are large enough
for us to stand upright. In some of them a bamboo
bed denotes the sojourn of some pilgrim or belated
fisherman. One division, which is reached by a
rectangular entrance, is filled with a multitude of
small divinities of the same size and form. This must
be a reserve stock, for the walls are covered with red
and gilt paper. Our candle diminishes, we must think
of getting back. AVe have been walking nearly five
hours.  
  
  
  Our pirogues descend the stream between

welluntil justice is done us; that is to say until the whole
of the territories stolen from our proteges is restored
to them.


We have rights. They must be fully recognised,
without tergiversation, without compromises, without
concessions. And I know no juster echo of our
claims, no criterion more certain, no applause more
sincere than the attacks of the Bangkok as well as of
the London press; because for the most part abroad,
and particularly in the far East, when the Englishman
protests, it is because we are in the right, our interest
being usually opposed to his own. And it is by
not letting our ears be deafened by the frantic cries
uttered that we shall ensure for France in the China
seas the place which is due, and that we shall render
her great, solid, and respected.


Note. — Since these lines were written grave events have
passed in Siam. The Government has been justly aroused by
encroachments, on the part of our neighbours, which nothing
justified. They counted too much on our indifference. The
energetic attitude of the cabinet, the boldness and the cleverness
of our sailors, the firm and worthy language of the quai d'Orsay
easily got the better of Siamese pretensions. The court of
Bangkok found itself forced to meet our claims. It is never too
late to act when the interests and the honour of the country are
at stake. In face of the foreigner every personal question must
disappear, all party spirit vanish, to give place only to French
feeling. Thus we ought all of us to congratulate ourselves on the
result recently obtained by the Government in Siam, while at
the same time trusting that the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
recalling the engagements of his predecessors, recorded in the
English blue books, may preserve towards London and Pekin
the same attitude that he has taken towards Bangkok, whenever
the questions pending between the three Powers in the Upper

the blossoms and place them in their hair. Here the
river makes a great bend in the shape of an S, and
having followed its windings we enter an open space
filled with shingle banks. Laichau is in front of us,
standing upon a promontory, with one spur advancing
between the Song-B6 and one of its affluents, the
Song-Na. The hill has been cleared of wood, and is
covered with footpaths winding over its slopes. The
houses of the village are of a gray tint, blending with
the general colour of the landscape; the two rivers
below roar boisterously as they rush together in
turbulent rapids. At the extreme point of the
promontory, the first thing we see is a kind of huge
carcase of bamboos several yards high, formed like
a triangle standing on its point, ornamented with rags
and odds and ends of stuffs. This scaffolding would
have perplexed us if we had not heard of the death
of Deo Van Tri's father. A little higher the
tricoloured flag marks the French post, and we cross in
a ferry just as we did at Van Bou. Some native
women are bathing in front of us; they enter the
water, squat down, raising their petticoats as they
bend until they finally wind them like a turban round
their heads.


We are received at the post, where we install
ourselves; only a French sergeant and a few militiamen
now occupy it, for since the district has been pacified
the garrison has been considerably reduced. The chief
of the district lives opposite, so I send over by the
interpreter a letter that. M. Vacle has given me for
him and some messages that I received in Paris from
his nephews, who are students at the Colonial School.  
  
  
  On the morrow he pays us a visit. In appearance

tells me that they were made to cure him of a chest
disease.  
  
  
  March 26th.


After an hour's march by the side of the Nam
Nona, we reach the village of Sop-Nao; the route
that we have followed from Dien Bien is the one used
by the couriers when the rivers are low, but during
the rainy season they take a boat as far as Ban Ken
Kout (two days and a half from Sop Nao), and from
there they can get to Dien Bien on foot, in one day.


Although the region called Laos has not, properly
speaking, any clearly defined frontiers, we may
consider that we have crossed the eastern boundary
between Dien Bien and Sop Nao. Here the country
changes, and we appear to enter a more civilised
world; the houses are still based upon piles, but they
are better built than those of the Thais, and they are
arranged in regular lines on each side of a street; at
the entrance an empty hostelry is ready for travellers.
AVe hasten to place our luggage under shelter, for it is
raining, and we then leave our men to guard it.
Accompanied by Takiate, I repair to the Siamese post,
which is formed of a collection of huts rather laro-er
than the others, surrounded by a palisade; there is
no flag, but a great many women and dogs. The
garrison consists of twelve men, in European clothes
made of strong linen, and armed with Remingtons.
The officer in charge invites me to sit down and take
tea with him. He tells me that the boats are ready,
and promises to give us a letter for the chief of
Muong Ngoi. AVe leave him to superintend the
arrangement of our luggage on board the boats.

They light it with a steel and a wick made of fibres
taken from the bark of a tree. They also smoke
opium; Chinese caravans bring it to them raw, and
they pay about a rupee for nearly three quarters of an
ounce (twenty grammes), they cook it over the fire in
a small copper cup. Three Laotians from Luang
Prabang, who are also in the sala, devote themselves
to the same work; they are merchants, who have come
to buy rice. The apparatus ready and the lamps
lighted, each man lies down and we go to bed.  
  
  
  March 30th.


This morning Sao complains of colic; yesterday
evening he jostled a boatman and he now believes
that he is the victim of a spell; but his illness is
not serious.


During- the clay the view becomes more extended;
the river widens, and it is dotted with a number of
small rocky islands bearing a few shrubs. The
vegetation on the bank seems transformed; it ajyproaches that
of more southern countries than Upper Tonkin, and
I remark some bread trees. There are numerous
villages; the natives wear pink or yellow scarves, for
the inhabitants everywhere regulate the colour of
their stuffs by the light which they receive. In Asia
as in Europe, in Siberia or iu Tonkin, in Norway or
in Italy, it is curious to see that men, with respect to
objects that change according to their caprices so
much as clothes, always follow the law that nature
imposes upon animals, that of adaptation to their
surroundings. Here also we meet some Kas; the men
have a piece of wood or a bouquet of flowers in the lobe
<!-- Leaf 179, Page: 163 -->
above the sea, the higher peaks 5,400 feet. I find
some bamboos growing even here, by the side of
coniferous trees, something like our firs.


On both sides of the defile a few wooden houses
built upon the ground and covered with thatch
shelter the Meo families. The village contains about
eighty inhabitants, although the people will only
confess to numbering twenty-five, being afraid that
we have come to verify the taxes.


When we arrive every one comes out to meet
us. At first glance, the race seems handsome and
strong, particularly to any one coming from the delta
of Tonkin; the men are generally tall with fair and
open faces, the eyes are oblique, the mouth small, the
teeth white, the chin well formed and strong; their
mien is confident. As they plant each footstep they
seem to pause a moment to tread upon it more firmly, in
which one recognizes a people used to mountaineering.
The women are small and pleasing, their lips half open
in a perpetual smile, which displays a row of beautiful
white teeth; the nose is almost straight, the chin
delicate, the lower part of the face perfectly regular;
the eyes are just narrow enough to indicate that
they belong to Oriental faces. Attractive and lively,
they are distinctly different from the other races, and
form an agreeable change to eyes accustomed to the
Annamites and Thais of the plains.


By their costumes as well as by their type and
customs the Meos remind me of the Lolos that I met
at Setchuen; the men have the same fashion of
dressing the hair in front, which causes them to
be surnamed Unicorns by the missionaries. Here
they wear a black turban round the hair; they have

  CHAPTER II

Arrival in Tonkin—Haiphong, the question of a Trade Port,

the Custom-duties—A Visit to the Hong-Hay
Coal
fields—Kebao.

A branch line of the Messageries Maritimes effects
the service between Hong-Kong and Haiphong, and as
the steamers are small and the sea generally very
rough, they roll terribly, the voyage being a most
disagreeable one.


The steamer stops off Hai-nam, in order that a portly
German, who acts as British Consul in that town,
may fetch his letters and that some luggage may be
landed; while on the following morning we find
ourselves at the mouth of the Cua-Cam, which is the
river leading up to Haiphong. The coast is a very
low one, little above the sea level, and one looks in
vain for the vegetation which is to be seen on the
banks of the Ganges or the Donai. There are no
trees of any sort, nothing but rice fields, the only
break in the plain being the mountain chain of the
Dong-Trieu, which is a prolongation of the cliffs in
the bay of Halong. Seen from a distance, these
large rocks, with their jagged and contorted shapes,
make a very striking impression upon the traveller
who enters Tonkin for the first time, being so
<!-- Leaf 407, Page: 391 -->
unof our journey, and in spite of the pleasure of
receiving home news, I cannot help feeling a certain
sadness, something analogous to what a falcon must
experience when, having been loosed in the hunt,
returns to his master's hand to be put again beneath
the hood.


The petty embarrassments, annoyances, pettinesses,
conventional obligations of civilised life, with its
atrocious uniformity, are now to be taken up once
more, and with these ennuis the monotonous droning
of the same sounds, the same stories.


At nine o'clock, Bangkok. I stayed there
threedays. Needless to expect of me a description of this
great town, which I will qualify as rastaquouere. It
thinks itself distinguished and elegant, simply because
it has hidden its origins and its local colour under
the trappings of the first European civilisation
which lay within its reach. It is the history of
one of those little Japanese mousmes, who thinks
to become French by throwing aside her Kimono
in order to dress in the Paris style. She loses her
nationality without gaining a new one. She is no
longer anything at all.


Its deep canals, where the sun-light plays upon the
water across the foliage of the trees; its floating
population; its large rivers furrowed by steamers, tugs,
merchant boats, and yachts; its numerous pagodas,
sometimes purely Siamese, sometimes borrowed directly
from the Hindoo style; the altars on which you
find, beside the Hindoo linguam, paper flowers under
glass globes or crystal balls; its marble statues rudely
representing Englishmen in pantaloons and tall hats,
while behind, on the walls, stretch in startling
frescoes the episodes of the Ramayana; its great white
<!-- Leaf 328, Page: 312 -->
excluded, viz., that of the bonzes and the aspirants to
that order. The creed is Buddhism, very much the
same as in Burmah and Siam. Apart from a few
freethinkers, who are regarded as brands plucked for the
burning, the people are religious, that is to say they
flock to the pagodas for certain festivals, bring presents,
and provide liberally for the bonzes. Luang Prabang
and its suburbs have about eighty pagodas, distributed
over four parishes, at the head of each being a bishop,
who is to be distinguished from the other priests by a
short skirt of violet-coloured silk. The ordinary priests
are invariably attired in yellow, with a long skirt and
with drapery thrown back over the shoulder like the
Lamas of Thibet, while they all have shaved heads.
The hierarchy is as follows, to begin from the
bottom :—


The Tiona (brethren) : these are the aspirant priests
or students; in many cases sent to the pagoda by
their family for a brief stage.


The Tiammone (priests) : these have already taken
the vow of celibacy.  
  
  
  The Satouhs, or venerables.


The Satouk Kron, or venerable masters. A priest
becomes Satouk by popular election, and the people
consecrate their choice by pouring the water of
purification over the priest whom they have chosen.


The king alone names the Satouk Kron, who are
appointed by his pouring "royal water" over them
during one of the great festivals when the idols are
being- washed.


All the members of the religious corporation reside
in the buildings near the pagodas, and they comprise
nearly a tenth of the population, as a portion of the

when he sees us. He is a small old man with a
black, wrinkled skin, whom I take at first for a
sorcerer. My blunder is all the more excusable
because he w^ears a bracelet made of beads round the
ankles, and is crouched over a heap of burning weeds
which emit a dense smoke. The boatmen explain to
me that he is merely making charcoal. After
breakfast a five hours' march over a very hilly road brings
us to a small village on the right bank which, we are
told, is the Chinese Van Bou. Although very hilly
the route is a good one, the brush having been
completely cleared away, and the obstacles either removed
or the road traced around them, so that in many
places two horses can go abreast. It is a long time
since we have come upon such a good road, and we
feel sure that a Frenchman has had his hand in the
work. Surely enough, about half an hour beyond
the village, the route which had been
runningthrough the wood about 150 feet above the river,
plunges into a forest of reeds, crosses the narrow
valley, and then descends once more to the bank
which is opposite to the post-house, where, after a
short march, we arrive and are cordially received by
Colonel Pennequin, who is in command of the fort.
<!-- Leaf 56, Page: 40 -->

Upon our return to Hong-Hay, M. Durrant took
us over the various establishments, the construction of
which is necessitated by a large enterprise such as his :
the telegraph which connects with Haiphong, the
telephone to the different places on the works, the offices,
the covered-in pay-box, to which the Annamites
come for their wages like railway travellers going to
take a ticket, the map and chart-room, and the club to
which all the Europeans belong, this latter being well
provided with newspapers and a billiard-room.
Beyond these buildings is the street of the shops, all kept
by Chinese of course, and further still the Annamite
town with its small Canhas. It is divided into two
parts by a large square, as a precaution against fire.
A small pond acts as a sewer, the raising of a sluice
serving to carry off the rubbish and filth into the open
sea, while the rest of the detritus is conveyed at night
in sampans to Port Courbet, where it is put into a pit
and burnt.


In a few months time, the new and growing town
will be provided with the electric light, and as the
motive power is already at hand, the only expense
will be the purchase and fitting up of the machinery,
and at the present time the fifty-eight oil-lamps cost
nearly ten shillings a day.


It is not always an easy matter to administer the
native town, as while it is necessary to expel the
goodfor-nothing characters who take refuge there, it is not
possible to address a complaint to the resident at
QuanYen without some specific motive, so that there must be
a certain degree of arbitrary conduct. M. Durrant had
thought of applying for a mandarin, but the latter
would soon have become master of the situation, so,

Evening—Mekong—Pakou—The Arrival at Luang Prabang

—The Consulate.

From Laichau we go to Dien Bien Fou in five stages,
for though the journey can be accomplished in three,
we are delayed by our coolies. On the first day we
left late and only advanced about nine miles. Until
we stop at the foot of the hills, at Muong Toum, the
road lies on the banks of the Nam Lai; the slopes have
been cleared of wood half the way up, but above that
height the trees are covered with white blossoms which
give them from a distance the appearance of large
orchards. The bottom of the valley is rich and
wrell cultivated, it contains numerous villages. The
itinerary given to me at the post mentions 260 houses.
I should think that the number had increased, for there
must be at least 2,000 inhabitants and a great
manypeople are seen on the road. The women wear
dossers fastened with braces or by a strap passed
across the forehead, they then cross their arms, behind
them. I often notice tattoo marks upon the hands,
<!-- Leaf 418, Page: 402 -->
is valued at 3,000,000 taels (about £720,000) and
Puerh tea, the annual export of which amounts to
more than £160,000. Part of the trade in the last
article, however, may take the Black River route.


As for imports (by way of Tonkin) the province
will take cotton, and I mention it first, because it is
this product, perhaps, which — more perhaps even
than coal—is destined to be the future wealth of
Tonkin. Neither Yunnam nor Setchuen produce
cotton, importing it from the neighbouring provinces,
Setchuen to the amount of nearly £1,000,000 per
annum. In 1891, according to the statistics of the
Mungtze customs houses, cotton was imported to
the amount of £18,000. It comes to Yunnam from
Burmah, the Shan States, Siam, and the Province
of Canton, and according- to Hallett, cotton bought
at Xienghay for Yunnam-Sen has to be transported
for six weeks before it reaches that place, at a cost
of £80 per ton.


By way of the Red River a ton of merchandise
costs only £18 10s. even now from Hanoi to
YunnamSen.


On the other hand, cotton comes from Burmah in
seventy pound bales, is stored at Tenne and
TongTchong, whence it goes to Tali in sixty pound bales,
and is thence sent on to Houi-li-Tcheou (western
Setchuen). At Tali, it is worth eighteen taels per
hundred pounds, say about £36 a ton. The route
from Yunnam-Sen to Houi-li-Tcheou being more
direct than that vid Tali, it is easy to see with the
figures under one's eyes the important place which,
in Yunnam and Setchuen, the raw cotton exported
from Tonkin must occupy.
<!-- Leaf 379, Page: 363 -->
Hong, which took a month upon the journey by
short stages, eight being loaded with iron, four with
tea, and the rest with Chinese groceries, sugar, opium
and a little silk.


In short, trusting to what I saw and to the
information supplied me, I arrive at the following
conclusions. The Laos is not nearly so rich a country as
has been generally asserted, the trade of Luang
Prabang more especially being insignificant. There
is not an opening for more than one or two French
houses, who should make it then- business to act as
middlemen for an European stock of goods, to purchase
the native products, to develop as far as possible
among a people naturally inclined to be lazy local
industries, to undertake, with Kas workmen, the
extraction of minerals and the cutting of timber.
But in order to establish our political and commercial
influence in the Laos, it is not enough that we should
speak our mind at Bangkok, we must make the most
of the advantages which the proximity of the coasts
of Annam give us.


With this object in view, what we should do is to
set about the making of a carriage road pending the
construction of a railway which will connect the coast
with the nearest point at w-hich the navigation upon
one of the branches of the Mekong begins, while the
terminus of the line upon the coast must be where
there is a safe harbour for trading vessels. In my
judgment, Tourane, with its magnificent bay and its
coal supply, or Ai Lao, with the Tchepone at its feet,
would be the two best places. But the work should
be commenced without delay, and I would ask those
<!-- Leaf 79, Page: 63 -->
going-Meiffre, on the banks of the Black River, which
was ravaged by pirates before the crop was ripe, was
mainly due to the conditions on which it was granted,
the Government having been imprudent in taking
from the natives, to cede it to Frenchmen, the long
strip of cultivated land along the river bank, the
former having their revenge for this in the way
described. To whatever cause they may be ascribed,
these first failures need not discourage the colonists.
If they look at the Indian plantations, or, to go much
further, those which the Russians, by dint of
persevering efforts and energy, have formed beyond the
deserts of Bokhara, around Tashkend, they will find
that these plantations yield a return of 40 per cent.,
so that we may have full confidence in the future of
cotton in Tonkin.


Another textile plant destined to give very good
results, is the white or Chinese nettle, which grows
wild in Tonkin, the roots lasting for twenty years.
There are several large plantations of it near Calcutta,
and there is a market for it at Liverpool, all that
is required being to simplify and improve the method
of decortication. Tea grows upon the hill-sides of
Sontay and in other localities above the delta, but in
order to make it pay we must alter the mode of
cultivation, of gathering and preparing the leaves, for the
produce, as it now is, cannot compare with the
excellent tea which the Chinese send into the district of
Ibang, which is contiguous to Tonkin. What we
ought to do is to secure the services of some of their
workmen to initiate the Annamites into their methods,
in which case there is no reason why Tonkin should
not be for Indo-China what Ceylon is for India.
<!-- Leaf 372, Page: 356 -->
So far as the ethnography, the flora and the fauna
of Laos are concerned, no better authority is to be
had than the French naturalist, Henri Monhot,
whose scientific missions were paid for with English
money and who succumbed to an attack of fever at
Luang Prabang on the 10th of November, 1861. A
small monument erected to his memory by the Gamier
Mission was restored by M. Pavie, and it is a
whitewashed cenotaph upon which may be read in blue
letters the inscription  
  
  
  H. Monhot,  
  
  
  1890.


The site of this is a space which has been cleared
in the woods which skirt the Nam Kane about an
hour's march above Luang Prabang, Monhot having
died in a village beyond this. The chief of a Leu
village receives six piastres to keep the monument in
order and collect insects, besides being the
balletmaster and master of ceremonies in his native place.


Upon the right bank of the Nam Kane is a hill
of chalk, with large blocks covering the slopes, and
the tradition is that they are not there by chance but
were placed there by order of former sovereigns as a
hiding-place for their treasures.


The fauna of Indo-China has been studied in so much
detail by the expeditions of Gamier, Monhot, Neis,
Harmand, and others, that I cannot do better than
refer the reader whom this subject may happen to
interest, to the records of their researches; and with
regard to the flora it is very varied, among the most
interesting features of it being the beautiful parasite
orchids, some rose and others yellow-. The country is

Archer remarks, "neither Cambodia nor Annam will be
able to hold their own against Siam in competing for
the trade of the valley of the Mekong." Unless, as I
would add, we contrive to compete upon equal terms
and to meet rail with rail and steamer with steamer,
opposing to the Korat line, which is intended
to unite the gulf and port of Bangkok with the
Mekong, a much shorter line connecting the great
river with the coast of Annam. This line might be
made between A'inh and Houtene, or, better still, if
the information of Captain Cupet and Captain de
Malglaive may be trusted, between Tourane, which
is destined by its position, in the centre of the
IndoChinese curve, as by the breadth and depth of its
bay, to become the chief port of Annam, and Ban
Monc, by way of Quang Tri and Ailao. The line
might perhaps terminate at this latter town, whence
canoes at all seasons, and sloops during three months
out of the twelve, can reach the Mekong. The
distance from the coast is inconsiderable, and the
maximum of altitude is 1,000 feet. The Annamites were
right when they named the village built upon the
Tchepone " Ai Lao," the gate of the Laos, for it is by
there that all the trade of the Upper Mekong must
pass as far as the confluence of the Sehang Hien. So
soon as goods can be brought to Ai Lao at a
lowfreight, and that steam sloops can navigate the
Mekong and its tributaries, the commercial current of
Luang Prabang will be diverted, to our advantage,
from the route over which it travels at present. AVe
should no longer have any reason to be afraid of
Korat or Bangkok, and Tourane will be the Bombay
of Annam, the entrepot of the Laos.
<!-- Leaf 311, Page: 295 -->
Son La. They also took natives who were under
our protection from Song Ma and made them march
thirty days to drink in secret " the water of the oath "
at a pagoda outside the town, and they are now eager
to seize the rich table-lands of the Pon6n. Thus in
1891 ten Annamite chiefs who had been sent into
this region by the French Resident at Vinh, with
interpreters in our service, were, against the faith of
treaties, arrested and sent to Bangkok by order of
the Siamese colonel commanding at Luang Prabang,
the interpreters beaten, and our flag torn to rags.
Only a few days ago an officer put up a proclamation
in the town threatening with death all friends of the
French, and, in order to obtain reparation for this
insult M. Massie was obliged to make a personal
business of it and talk of calling the colonel out,
So much for the influence possessed by our agents !


The young chiefs, powerless to maintain their
autonomy, prefer making a complete surrender to
their new masters; and I recently learned that the
king had sent for Thais from Theng, that is to say
our subjects,1 who had been transported to the
confines of Luang Prabang, and had promised to pay
them for cultivating the soil, if they would undertake
not to quit his kingdom; because Siam may succeed
in extending its power and spoliating its neighbours,
we must not conclude that it is in good odour with
its neighbours—very much the contrary.


1 It is said that there were from four to five thousand of
them. We might take their interests in hand and, following the
tactics adopted by England and Russia, form a nucleus of
proteges, the defence of whom would invest our agent with a very
valid motive for appealing to the local authorities.

a consulate, this land is now the site of the residences
of the Governor-General, the general in command of
the troops, the staff, and the admiral, all of them facing
the river and being in the midst of very large
gardens, while the military buildings and the barracks
give this tract of land the appearance of being the
suburb of a town.


A road running parallel with the marshes through
lands which have not been built over, leads in the
course of a few hundred yards, to the Rue Paul Bert,
which is the centre of the French quarter. This street
is the axis around which the colonists and
functionaries gravitate, it being here that they live and move
and have their being.


When we Frenchmen colonise, we often manifest
great inexperience and want of foresight; but side by
side with these defects are certain good qualities
which we carry with us all over the globe. In the
first place, we have a knack of clearing a native town
and of constructing by the side of it something at
once clean and elegant, utilising the smallest detail
so as to make the whole effect pleasing to the eye.
The good taste of the Montmartre grisette is to be
traced in the work of the Californian pioneer and the
Cochin-China non-commissioned officer, that subtle
and intangible something which is derived from our
temperament and is of our very essence accounting
for the fact that, at a small outlay in money, we have
cleared out and partially reconstructed two of the
most beautiful towns in the Far East, Hanoi and
Saigon. Compare them with the English-built towns
of Bombay and Calcutta in India, or of Hong-Kono- in
China, and you will find in the latter larc-e and

Apart from the honour of the flag, the inducement
first held out to our representatives to convince them
of the necessity of conquering Tonkin, the most
tangible was beyond question the profit to be derived
from the mines. The figures were there to prove that
the gold mines already being worked paid the
Emperor of Annam nearly £40 of annual dues, and
that although the method of working was very
primitive, several large nuggets were b'eing found. Some
of these were exhibited in France, perhaps with
the hope of raising the "gold fever," which was
the starting point of the colonization of two of
the richest countries in the world, California and
Australia. But these illusions are now dispelled,
for that which was expected to impress the popular
imagination has dwindled into insignificance, and it

O o i
is seen that, in respect to the bringing out the wealth
of the colony, the mine question is no longer the sole,
perhaps not even the most important one. Not but
what many concessions for minerals have not been
applied for and granted, but the holders of them
are keeping them in reserve, being checked by the
lack of capital and the insecurity, two causes of
delay in the development of the countrv, to which I
shall have often need to refer.


I have already referred to the coal-fields of
HongHay and Kebao, and have mentioned that the seams
extend as far as the Yunnan. A company is
beingformed to work them at Quang-Yen, and some twenty
other concessions have been granted upon the banks

that are married, while marriage often follows the
birth of a child. Moreover, if the girl informs her
parents and reveals the name of her lover, the latter is
bound to pay a fine of about fifteen rupees, or to marry
her. All assaults upon women are taxed at varying
rates, there being different fines for a kiss upon the
mouth or upon the arm, and for rape. Adultery with
a married woman, which is of very rare occurrence,
entails a fine of 200 rupees; but, after having been
very gay in their youth, husband and wife generally
settle down quietly, the former often taking it out of
his wife for her unceremonious treatment of him
beforehand. I happened, while wralking about the
town one morning, to witness one of these little
family scenes. A woman was shrieking and crying
because her husband had been beating her, and when
I came to question the pair, the man complained that
his wife, who had been out to market, had not
returned by nine o'clock to get his breakfast ready, so
she must have stopped to gossip on the way. Her
answer was that she had not heard the gong strike
the hour, that she had not stopped on the way home,
and that there was no reason why she should have
had a beating. The quarrel was eventually made up
without having- recourse to a divorce, which, though
legally recognised, is rarely resorted to.


The code of morals, it will be seen, is a rather loose
one, but this does not prevent the affection of the
parents for their children from being very strongly
developed. I have rarely seen children made so much
of or so closely looked after as they are here.


It is not every man, indiscriminately, who is allowed
to pay court to the young women, for one class is

succeeded one another upon this soil for so many
centuries, than the work of any great artist, seems to
have concentrated in its attitude, its countenance, and
its gaze, the essence of the moral beliefs, the object
of existence, and the reason of death, as they were
conceived by one-half of the old world. The foreign
traveller who seats himself upon the floor of a pagoda,
aud keeps his eyes steadily fixed for some time upon
the principal idol, must mentally be so far hypnotised
by it as to feel springing up in him ideas of charity,
of detachment from worldly things, of
self-contemplation, of resignation to the inevitable, and of being
absorbed in the vast whole reflected by Buddha.


AVTith the exception of the principal statue, the
gods are not seated, and in this pagoda of Ouate Mai",
the divinity held in the greatest veneration is one
with outstretched hands as if in the act of giving the
benediction. This is the Prabang or " Buddha of the
gold washings," as he is made out of the gold found
in the district. Tradition has it that this deity was
brought here by the Laotians, when they emigrated
from Muong-Theng, and that, after being carried off
to Bangkok by the Siamese, it was brought back to
Luang Prabang about twenty years ago. Another
legend is that the statue was sent about 200 years
ago by the king of Cambodia; but in any case it has
given its name to the town, and it is covered with
embroideries and chasubles, and placed in the recess
of a reliquary to which diverse ornaments are
suspended. In front of this is a movable bronze
grating, ending in two dragons with intertwined tails,
called Nak,, while to the left of the altar is a pulpit
very similar to a sedan chair, from which the bonzes
<!-- Leaf 159, Page: 143 -->
said, with tears in his eyes, how sorry he was, but
\"la France avant tout ! " These words will bring us
good luck, for we, too, have but one object in view,
to contribute towards the greatness of our country.
It is only when one is far away that one ajjpreciates
the charm of meeting compatriots whose hearts beat
in unison with one's own.


We shall miss little Yao, whose reflections imbued
with scepticism so amused me. As long as he had
enough to eat and a lodging for himself and his papa
(M. Vacle), he was indifferent to all the rest, especially
as to religious matters, about which he had no time to
think, and he would say very often, " Buddha same
thing as bamboo."


A few hours after the departure of M. Vacle and
Yao for Cho-Bo, on the morning of February 5th, we
make another start, having laid in a fresh stock of
provisions, with rice for the boatmen at the rate of
11 lbs. per day for four men. In order to avoid all
discussion between the garrison and the natives, the
colonel in command of the region has fixed the price
of rice at the rate of about 7s. a cwt. We also have
some fresh fish, and I have provided myself with
about fifty cartridges containing Fane powder, which
produces the same effect as dynamite without the
risk of explosion. One of these, provided with a
percussion cap, with a fuse burning under the water and
weighted with a stone, is very serviceable to us. The
effect of the explosion is felt over a radius of ten feet,
and as soon as the bubbling of the water subsided the
fish which had been killed rose to the surface stomach
upwards, our men being eager to jump in and bring
them back between their teeth. These cartridges are
<!-- Leaf 350, Page: 334 -->
one of Nangmanouba, a woman standing up on a
dragon, and another of a personage wearing a costume
very similar to that which was in vogue with us
during the middle ages.


The same subject is to be seen, let me add, in the
pagoda of Benom, and in a fresco at Xienhoung.
Inside one of these two pagodas is a series of frescoes
and pictures, eighteen of these latter representing the
popular history, revealed in nearly all the pagodas of
the king Pra Metsandaha, who, out of charity, gives
away his chariot, his horses, his wife and his children,
and who is, in the end, driven out of his kingdom.


To the left of the market there is a small plain,
with a few pools and the remains of an unfinished
pagoda, while nearer the Mekong is the Ouate Sieng
Muong and then the royal palace, fenced in by a
rectangular palisade of bamboo. The guard is
formed of about forty Laotians dressed in yellow
canvas and armed with European weapons, and
their guard-house, with sentinel boxes on each side
of the gates, is about in the centre. The palace
consists of three buildings; that in the centre, which
is of brick, and will, when finished, have two storeys,
being the new palace, while to the right a white
house with green blinds is the residence of the old
king, his son, who now holds the reins of
government, living to the left in what looks very much like
a Swiss chalet of yellow wood. AVe commence our
visit by the last named, the Siamese Colonel coming
to meet us on the steps,1 while the king is waiting

since. We are entitled to expect that he will take
the steps which he deemed necessary to repair them,
notably the suppression of the Colonial Council as it
is at present organized, and the re-establishment of
the excellent training-school which produced such
wonderful results.  
  
  
  finance.


A defective financial system is the necessary
outcome of a defective administration, and, without
attempting to examine into the question of the
incidence of taxation, I think that I shall be echoing
the feelings of most of the colonists in making the
following criticisms :—


The generalization of monopolies, the opium
concession, more particularly in the establishment of
which the views of interested persons were quite
ignored, and in regard to wdiich there has been as
much waste as upon the Langson railway. This has
encouraged smuggling and consequently piracy,
prevented the cultivation of other crops which would be
very productive in the country, and injured trade in
general by prohibiting the use as an object of exchange
of an article which, in Tonkin at one time as in China
still, was constantly employed as current coin, because
of its taking up so little room, being so high in price,
and so generally in use. These monopolies in many
cases offend the natives, and a resident told me that
this had been the case with the forest of Thai-Hoa.
Whole rafts of floating timber had been abandoned
by the inhabitants of the district rather than pay
exorbitant duties to those who had obtained a grant
<!-- Leaf 402, Page: 386 -->
  
  twice a month by a small steamer of the Compagnie
Nantaise, the Jean-Baptiste Say. The agents of the
Celestial Empire, whom I regard as above all things
practical, do not risk trading with Saigon, because of

the red-tape formalities and the high duties. As for
us, we are waiting to create important trading
companies as in Tonkin, until our capitalists are a little
less timorous; and we are allowing other nations to
take the place which the geographical position and
importance of our colonies ought to make us the first
to occupy.


It is the 12th of May before we reach Bangkok, eager
to finish our journey, for we are fatigued, and our last
stage, in spite of the apparent comfort we enjoyed
after the navigation of the Black River, has not
rested us. Continual anxieties, the frequent ill-will
of the boatmen and the inhabitants, the changing of
boats, the delays due to lack of knowledge or false
information, the shallowness of the water, the
sandbanks and the tree-trunks which are as bad as
the rapids, and above all the heat, followed by rains
and storms; all these worries, annoyances and
difficulties leave behind them unpleasant memories of the
Menam.


Our bodyguard is, if possible, more useless on the
water than on land. Provided to protect us they come
to implore our protection. On May 8 th, at Pae Nam
Po they complain of having been upset, of having lost
all their goods (?) and of having been maltreated by
the Chinese, asking us to judge between them.


What took place was this. The Chinese here have
the monopoly of tobacco, and as a good deal of
tobacco conies from Pitchai they have established a
<!-- Leaf 71, Page: 55 -->
have a look at the citadel, which is a square building
with high, gray walls, the foundation of which goes
down to a deep moat, now partly dried up. It is
more than half a mile in length, and it is easy to see
by the shape (the Vauban system) and the style of
building that it is not the sole work of Asiatics;
and, as a matter of fact, it was built in the last century,
under the supervision and after the plans of Colonel
Olivier, who was sent out to Nguyen after the
signature of the treaty between France and Annam.
Of French origin, this fortress was destined a century
later to become the theatre of exploits so extraordinary
upon the part of a handful of Frenchmen, led by two
heroes, that they seem to belong rather to the domain
of romance. I refer, of course, to the capture of the
citadel of Hanoi in 1873, by Gamier and Dupuis, at
the head of two hundred men. In building these
walls, Olivier little dreamt that a Frenchman would
be called upon to raze them, though Commandant
Riviere's work of demolition was never completed,
and they have since been rebuilt. There is some
intention, I believe, of entirely demolishing the fortress
in order to give more space to the Annamite town.


Beyond the citadel there are several pagodas, notably
those of the Great Buddha and of the Crows, which
are well worth a visit, but my object is not to serve
as a guide, but to give in a few lines a summary
description of the town where I have to stay for a
week—in the first place because there are still several
preparations to be made for our journey, and in the
second because I am anxious to gather upon the spot
the different views held as to our present situation in
Tonkin.
<!-- Leaf 199, Page: 183 -->
are not looking for gold here. A burrow has been
discovered, inhabited by a large species of rat, which
sometimes weigh as much as twenty pounds; their
flesh is excellent. A fire of brushwood lighted at
the mouth of the burrow has smothered them, and
now it is only necessary to dig deeply to uncover the
bodies; but we have not time to witness the capture.


We lunch at the bottom of a basin at Bophien Noi.
It is smaller and less circular than that of Molou; the
two or three families that live here extract and wash
the auriferous sand by the system already described.
They tell us that after working for some time without
any results, they only recommenced finding gold
after the erection of a small pagoda; the spirits have
rewarded them, and now they place pots containing
sticks of perfume near the sand wells. The gold
found here is like rather fine dust; there are no
nuggets even the size of a grain of rice. Sao buys a
little gold, asserting that it is an excellent remedy
against disease.


During the remainder of the day the road
continues quite as undulating as in the morning; it
finally opens into a large valley, shut in on one
side by a calcareous cliff more than 600 feet high.
We stop at the foot of this wall, in the village of
Ban-May. From here to Van Bou there are but two
stages; the first is divided by luncheon and a short
halt at Maison. This is a large borough of seventeen
houses, the capital of the province. The chief, a stout
old man, wearing a silk jacket, like the Chinese,
comes to meet us with some of the leading men, and
invites us to rest at his house. His dwelling, which
is very pretty and still new, was built last year, and

On returning to Haiphong, we merely spend the night
there, joining the boat at the Messageries Fluviales
the next morning for Hanoi. The voyage up the river
occupies fourteen hours, the navigation being
difficult, especially in the Canal des Bambous, which
connects the Cua-Cam and the Red River, the bends
being very frequent and the steamer having only
just room to turn. Two natives, one to starboard
and the other to larboard, sound the river with
longbamboos, which they pull out at intervals to see what
the depth of water is. As we went up, our steamer
just touched the bottom, but we were not stopped,
more fortunate in this than the steamer which we
passed going down, as she was delayed for several
hours.


The scenery is monotonous, as we are in the midst
of the delta, with nothing but water as far as the eye
<!-- Leaf 271, Page: 255 -->
on the level of the plain, and therefore exposed to a
surprise, whilst the new position overlooks the whole
country, and thus commands the highways from
SopNao, Lai, and Tuan-Giao. As yet Ban-Loun
contains but four or five huts, for the inhabitants only
settled here five years ago. They make an income
by raising silkworms, as well as by agriculture, and
they show me some beautiful yellow cocoons, which
are destined to boil in a large saucepan of hot water.
The silk is then wound into skeins. It is coarse and
rough, but it sells at Luang Prabang for twenty-five
times its weight in silver. A superior quality is
worth fivepence for twenty grammes (about
twothirds of an ounce). The silkworms receive a great
deal of attention. Mulberry leaves are given to them
three times a day, and with the introduction of
improved processes of working the silk, this industry
should one day develop into a source of considerable
wealth for the plain of Dien Bien Fou.  
  
  
  March 25th.


In the hills we follow the worst road that I have
yet seen. It is good for the feet—neither too
muddy nor too stony, but it is dangerous for the
head. It has been badly cleared, so that we can
only pass over it on foot, up a succession of rather
steep ascents, and we are obliged to stoop every
moment. Branches catch in our hats and knock
against our guns. The creepers have to be separated,
and unexpected thorns cover our hands with blood.
The places that have been fired are still worse.
Branches have fallen across the path; trunks of trees
<!-- Leaf 167, Page: 151 -->
though well in sight, keep quite out of shot, and it
is not until they hear the hoarse roar of a stag that
they make clean off. As wre advance, we detect traces
of a tiger in the high grass, but night is falling, and
we deem it more prudent to return.  
  
  
  February llWt.


Our men do not seem any the wrorse for their
junketing of the previous day, being, if anything,
more alert than ever, and we encounter just as many
rapids and pass through the same scenery, though the
hills seem more distant, with higher peaks in the
background. It is better walking along the bank of
the river, and we kill birds with very brilliant plumage,
the multi-coloured œthyopiga with such metallic tints,
which are the fly-catchers of this country. Our boys
do not concern themselves much with these collections,
and Thou, who cannot understand what interest there
is in birds and insects, is only concerned to know
whether there is a tiger about.


My attention was drawn, near a village on the
right bank, to a slab surrounded by a small railing
and surmounted by an iron cross with the following
inscription :—

I uncover before the grave of one of those many
Frenchmen, nearly all unknown, who have without
<!-- Leaf 392, Page: 376 -->

For three consecutive days we are in the forest,
often in the real virgin forest, where enormous lichens
hang from the branches, and among immense trees
of the fig species, which seem made at the base of
numerous little columns close packed one upon the
other, but which, only seven or ten feet higher up,
become a single smooth white ball. The natives call
this tree Mai Puei, and it furnishes an excellent
material for oars. The landscape here is fine, it
being a pleasure to look upon this magnificent
vegetation, in the midst of which one seems to be
steeringone's way like a dwarf, dreading at every step to see
the walls of the narrow passage closing about one,
and to be choked to death.


Alas ! the virgin forest is only the exception, and
more often the way lies amidst random woods,
consisting of trees which have a bark like that of the oak.
These trees are of average height and straight; but
instead of branches, large leaves issue from the trunk,
as in the dreary forest of Nepaul. Sometimes you
find orchids bunched on the trees with pink or yellow
flowers and purple spots. I pluck some, in spite of
the difficulties in gathering them caused by having to
get off and on our animals, and to avoid the ants
which are usually found in the roots of these plants
and which -we cannot escape. Apart from the interest
of the orchids (and I have seen only three kinds of
these), I know nothing in the world so monotonous
as travelling in these woods with the same limited
vista ever ahead, devoid of horizon or variety
or life. Not a bird note, not a cry, not a living
being. You imagine yourself carried back some
thousands of years, a silent spectator at one of
<!-- Leaf 36, Page: 20 -->
navigation which no circumstances could affect, and,
in spite of its drawbacks, the number of vessels coming
up to Haiphong has considerably increased within the
last year, the total being 42 as against 20, and of
these 15 were French and 14 German. But of the
15 French vessels, 6 were State transports, so that
we are still much behindhand in regard to navigation
and trade in the far East. During the last fifteen
years, the Germans have rapidly given us the go-by,
for whereas at one time their firms hired our vessels,
the contrary is now the case. We have been too
much the slaves of routine; and not having had the
hardihood to sacrifice our sailing ships to steamers,
we have been left behind in the competition by both
Germans and English.


Bad as it is, the situation of our merchant service
in this part of the world is not desperate, and our
flag ought to occupy a permanent place in the China
Seas. This is to be learnt from a report of M.
Gueyraud, our Consul at Hong-Kong, who gives in
detail the expenditure to be incurred upon trading
vessels in these waters and the return to be derived
from them, the affair being so profitable that many
German vessels are built by the co-operation of small
associations formed in the ports of Pomerania and
Holstein, tradespeople and even workmen entrusting
their savings to the managers of these enterprises. To
those who would urge that we cannot do the same
because we should have more expenses and because
the Colbert law makes it necessary that all the officers
and three-fourths of the crew should be French, I
may reply, in the words of M. Gueyraud : " French
vessels navigating in these distant waters, in a climate
<!-- Leaf 147, Page: 131 -->
the latter may find it worth his while to stop us and
put us to ransom. M. Vacle, however, undertakes
to see us safe into a pacific district, and I am much
pleased at finding in him not only a protector,
but a very pleasant companion, wTell posted in the
manners and customs of the country.


On the morning of the 10th. after a delay
caused by the distribution of poles—the boatmen
being very superstitious as to the choice of these—
we make a start upon the tranquil waters of the
stream, which is broad enough for our canoes to
proceed abreast. But M. Vacle warns me that it will
not be as pleasant work as this all the way, and
thinks that I shall alter my tune after having been
travelling for a few days.


Our first stage is a short one, as we have to wait for
other canoes which are conveying provisions to the
posts at Van-Yen and Van-Bou, as it is better to be
numerically strong in case of an attack by pirates.
We halt upon the right bank, and about half an hour
from the place of debarkation we reach the house of
the Dedoc Dinhto, an influential chief with much the
same standing as a general, who had formerly been a
pirate and hostile to us, but who has now made his
submission. It is important that we should see him
before we continue our journey, and we find him,
physically, a man of medium height, resolute in
aspect and with a face made all the sterner by the
sword cut which has pierced his cheek. Residing as a
rule at Cho-Bo, he is at present celebrating the " Tet "
at his country house, and the festivities appear to
have been very animated, as he is decidedly the
worse for drink. I succeed, however, in getting him

Luang Prabang, or rather Muong Luang Prabang,
meaning literally " the royal town of Prabang," so
named after a much venerated idol (Muong Luoung),
is a capital, and gives its name to a small State of
Laos, or a Shan State, to use the English expression.
In this connection it may be remarked that the centre
of Indo-China, and especially the region traversed by
the upper course of the Mekong, is made up of
kingdoms and principalities, formed for the most part
out of the same territory which surrounds a towm,
always at loggerheads with one another, absorbed one
after the other by the strongest States, and only
maintaining their independence in the interval through the
rivalry of their powerful neighbours. Paying tribute
first to the one side and then to the other, sometimes

she would have done in the first instance, without
attaining the same result. It is this system of driblets
which at present prevails in Tonkin.


Those whose duty it is to keep the Government
informed of what is going on do not dare to admit
the truth, for fear of its being too painful to swallow.
This is giving us credit for very little common sense.
Not only do they fail to speak the truth, but they say
the very opposite, and they are constantly Avriting
and telegraphing to say that " the Delta is pacified."


Letters and telegrams which seek to make us
believe this are all false, and the wish is father to the
thought, and the facts which are within my own
knowledge suffice to give the lie to the assertions of eminent
personages, who, with what they deem to be a patriotic
object, advance statements which it wTould be so easy
for them to prove if they were true. Let them only
traverse without an escort the region known as the
Delta from east to wrest. They need not even
announce their journey in advance, for the pirates
are well posted in what goes on, and any sort of
movement is brought to their knowledge. If, in these
circumstances, the traveller or travellers can, without
hindrance, start from Ninh-Binh, reach Kep and
Langson, and thence go down to Quang-Yen, all
the world will be convinced of the complete
pacification of the Delta, and I, for my part, will withdraw
all I have said and make the most humble apology.
But, pending that, I must crave leave to doubt the
value of the optimistic official statements with which
the French newspapers are inundated. Volumes
might be written about piracy and the means of
suppressing it, and questions of pure political

Seng who moved to Laichau.  
  
  
  March 5 th.


A hard day ! AVhen we left the woods at the end
of an hour and a half's marching we began to ascend
by a series of frequently very steep acclivities. The
hills are entirely cleared of wood, and still bear
traces of fire in the form of large black slabs;
elsewhere reeds conceal the bareness of the slopes. AVe
continue to climb until nearly two o'clock. As soon
as we reach one ridge we discover a second and a
higher one, and we begin to ask ourselves where this
tiring excursion will end. It seems as though w^e are
the dupes of an illusion, and that the hills mount at
the same time as we do. At last, we reach a small
terrace, which appears to be the ledge ofthe table-land.
The view is superb over the valley; my barometer
registers 5,220 feet. The woods recommence, and in
them I noted some new species unknown lower clown,
amongst others, some splendid tree-ferns, some of
them fifteen or eighteen feet high. Further on we
enter a country wdiich rather resembles the districts
round Caophong and Molou. Since we left Lai we
have seen only a slaty sod; here the calcareous
deposits reappear, and with them the large natural
basins. AVe can imagine, some millions of years ao-o,
the sea covering these regions, with circular atolls
appearing above the surface as they may still be
seen in Oceania. The phenomenon is similar, only
here we are 5,100 feet higher. Villages are rare,
but here and there we see a few low huts inhabited by
Meos or Yaos. Maize grows well, and it is cultivated

regular results, and I have selected celluloid plates,
which I always find produce very good proofs, despite
the heat or the damp. When the photographs have
been properly dried, they will be rolled up and placed in
tin tubes, previously done over with lampblack inside.
Preserved in this way, they will keep good at least
a year before being developed, for during our Thibet
journey I had some which came out wrell after being
kept thirteen months. On the chance of being able
to find time to develop a few en route, I have taken
the necessary materials, but I fear that there will be
little opportunity for this.


We have to take what money we shall require in
the form of piastres, which can, if we wTant to pay by
weight, be cut into fragments. An order for
payment of 500 rupees will be useful to us in the event
of our touching English territory, and, in addition
to the 1,600 piastres which I take with me from
Hanoi, I have made an arrangement with the Treasury
by which I shall be able to draw 400 more at
VanBou, while we have authority from the Marine
Commissariat to purchase provisions at the different forts.


A passport, too, was given us by the
GovernorGeneral, authorizing us to travel in the Laos
provinces and Siam, a certain number of these
beingsent from the Siamese Court at Bangkok to the French
Governor at Saigon, with the name of the person or
persons for whom it is intended left in blank, for it
appears that, despite the treaties which confer upon
us the right of navigating the Mekong, a Siamese
permit is necessary for the French who wish to
explore the upper valley of the stream, or even its
affluents on the left bank. For my own part, I have

  INDUSTRIES.


As a general rule, the development of industry in
a country follows that of agriculture and mining, so
that Tonkin, being backward in regard to the two
latter, is still more so in regard to the first named.
Still, a fewr manufactures are being established, the
Annamites are clever and quick at learning, wages
are low, and employers are satisfied with their
workmen.


Without going into many details, I may mention
the match factory at Hanoi, now in full working order,
and the typographic and paper-making establishment
of M. Schneider, a very fine paper for
newspaperprinting being made out of rice-pulp.


Then there are the undertakings of M.
BourgoingMeiffre, a very enterprising native of Lyons, who is
ably seconded by his strenuous and energetic wife,
which may be held up to the notice of the newly
arrived colonists. At one time he will be going to
collect badiane at the frontier of China, running the
risk of being assailed by pirates, and then he will be
collecting silk, the cocoons of which are unwound by
the Annamites whom he has drilled to the task, the
results which he obtains being so different from those
of the natives themselves that French visitors to
Tonkin who have come to study the silk question
can hardly believe their eyes. The belief was that
the Annamites did not understand how to rear the
silkworm and lost a part of the cocoon, so that there
could be no opening for the silk industry in Tonkin
for a long time. But the skeins which have already
<!-- Leaf 425, Page: 409 -->
was necessary to abandon Upper Burmah as a starting
point, and try to enter China through Siamese and
Shan territory.


The Route across the Shan States.—This left as
the best available route that which had been followed
by all the caravans from Moulmein or Rangoon to
Xieng-Mai, and thence to Xieng-Houng, the Golden
Road of Colquhoun. They had no longer, it is true,
the satisfaction of sending the products of India into
the very heart of China without quitting English
territory, this, however, being a mere matter of
sentiment, and of little importance compared to dollars and
rupees. Moreover, were there not ways of
makingthings pleasant all round ? Might they not protect
this poor King of Siam, isolated as he was in the
presence of the French brigands ? Had not Hallett,
moreover, advised his being taken by the hand and
introduced into the great British family %


As for the Shan States declared independent in
1882 by Colquhoun, who feared French influence, it
would not be difficult, once Burmah had been taken, to
recoo-nise the mistake. An understanding- could be

O w
come to in the south with Siam, and in the north
with China. They could be promised support against
aggression, and advised to make up for their losses by
action in the East against France which can put up
with anything. The end would be gained, and then
the railway line recommended by the Chamber of
Commerce, and by Colquhoun, and mapped out by Hallett
might be quietly constructed. The clay would come
when the locomotive, starting from Rangoon and
passino- through Xienohoung, would drain the riches of
the districts of Stesmao and Puerh, continue across
<!-- Leaf 102, Page: 86 -->
to the threats of China, has been to make concessions,
thus giving our adversaries all the points in the

game.


It is needless to recall all the humiliations which
we have had to go through in the Far East, or the
errors committed since the conclusion of treaties by
the intermediary of agents of the Anglo-Chinese
Customs, whom we decorated with the Legion of
Honour, and who made game of us, since the violation
by China of Clause VII. in the Treaty of Tien-Tsin,
which conferred upon us the original right to the
concession of railways, since the easy going surrender
of disputed frontier districts, up to the insults
levelled at our minister by the Viceroy of Petchili.
It seems to me that the measure is full to running
over, and after having been smitten upon one cheek
and tendered the other, we can go no further in
this direction unless we resign ourselves to be
kicked.


\"The blood mantled to my cheeks," remarked to
me an officer who had just come back from the frontier,
where he had seen our soldiers insulted, our landmarks
pulled up by the Chinese who spat upon them, our
flag outraged, while our men were formally instructed
to take no notice."


To those who would urge that the Chinese Empire
is of vast extent, that the provinces remote from the
central power do not respect its orders, that the Tsung
li Yamen is not responsible for what occurs at
Konang Si, I would begin by saying that this is not
so, and those who have any knowledge of China are
well aware of its method of procedure. Upon a
complaint of any kind being made by our minister, two
<!-- Leaf 28, Page: 12 -->
much as we can stand, and we return on board,
escorted by a crazy lad, who pursues us with his
plaintive cries, as if to reproach us for having come to
profane the orgies of his yellow brethren by our
presence, but he need not be alarmed; we are not likely
to repeat the visit.


We have a morning at our disposal before the
departure of the steamer which is to take us to
Tonkin, and it is spent in witnessing some
experiments with Tonkin coal, to which we have been
invited by Mr. Chater. The King of
Hong-Kongas he is called, is an Indo-Burmese Parsee, whose
brother is still in Burmah, and he is a man of such
ability that his fortune and influence have been
constantly on the increase. A regular Yankee in regard
to the boldness of his schemes and his large-minded
views in business, he has been for four years trying
to establish the sale of Hong-Kong coals, in the face
of many difficulties and severe criticisms, with a
perseverance and energy which denote great
intelligence. The French Government has, therefore, been
well advised in rewarding with the Legion of Honour
the important services which he has rendered to our
colony.


Mr. Chater is delighted to show us the results
which have already been obtained, and one of the
trim steam-launches, which are always flitting about
the harbour of Hong-Kong, takes us to the large sugar
refinery of Jardine and Matheson, the fact that our
funnel does not emit any smoke because it burns
Hong-Hay coal being, of course, pointed out to us.
It is easy to distinguish, by the orifices of the three
large chimneys of the refinery, what is the kind of
<!-- Leaf 171, Page: 155 -->
his hospitality as well as for his readiness to give us
information.


Formerly situated two days' march from the river,
at Son La, upon the right bank, in the midst of a
more elevated and more healthy plain, the
posthouse has recently been moved to a more central
position and one giving greater facilities of
communication. The buildings, which are of mud, with
the walls whitewashed and a thatched roof, are far
enough apart from one another for the inhabitants to
be perfectly at home, and they comprise residences
and mess rooms for the colonel, the officers, the
noncommissioned officers, and the post and telegraph
clerks, while there are also storehouses, and a
photographic studio. The families of the sharpshooters
reside in the Muongs huts built upon piles, and the
gates of the bamboo palisade are closed at night,
covered balconies (miradors) enabling- the sentinels
to keep watch over the outskirts.


The settlement is as yet only a provisional one,
for brick-kilns and lime-kilns have just been started,
and the present buildings will soon be replaced by
brick houses much higher aud more spacious. There
are two good kitchen gardens for supplying the
garrison with fresh vegetables, while several coffee
plantations have been made, and 300 eucalyptus trees
are already above ground.


Outside the post-house a native village has sprung
up, and Van Bou is probably destined to become a
very important centre, the colonel, in order to attract
settlers, having exempted the Annamites from forced
labour and from the capitation tax, while several
Chinese have already opened shops there. Caravans
<!-- Leaf 81, Page: 65 -->
cafe's and bars tells much in their favour, and their
example proves that there is an opening in Tonkin
for every one, even if he has little capital,
provided that he is willing to work.


To be done with the matter of cultivation, there
is the tobacco plant, which, to judge by the products
of the Dutch Indies, might become a source of great
profit for Upper Tonkin. Opium does very well,
but the institution of the farming-out system makes
the cultivation less profitable than it might be, while
upon the other hand the business transactions with
the bordering provinces of China were settled in
Tonkin opium, which was very valuable and went
into a very small compass. The treaty by which we
are prevented from exporting salt also prohibits that
of opium, and our neighbours were well advised
when they brought forward these clauses, in order to
place difficulties in the way of our commercial
relations with them by way of Tonkin.


In order to assist agriculture, the Government has
formed an experimental garden in the neighbourhood
of Hanoi, and the manager has made the very utmost
of the limited resources at his disposal. The
colonist is sure of finding the plants he first requires
at a very cheap rate, and many plants are sent to
different parts to be experimented upon. These
efforts to introduce and to acclimatize plants hitherto
unknown in the country had already been tried by
the much-regretted Monseigneur Pugenier, whose
immense agricultural establishment at Kecheu may
well serve as a type and pattern for the European
colonist.  
  
  
  There is one weak point in the conditions which  
  
  
 
<!-- Leaf 111, Page: 95 -->
1it will scarcely be credited that the sum allotted by
the government for the construction of new buildings
was fifteen piastres : that is to say not quite fifty
shillings. This was all that the troops were to expect,
apart from their own resources in money and labour.

Since then, much has been done to improve the
condition of the troops, but it is still very far from
what it should be. In proof of this, let me mention
that a battalion of marine infantry has received no
European outfit since 1889, and in some posts there
are more men than there are boots, so that the soldiers
can only go out by turns. In other places they have
to wear odd buttons with their uniforms, and to get
the Chinese to cut out anchors in red cloth to fasten
on to their collars.


That is what we are reduced to, the protests of
officers, even of generals being powerless, while the
staff sends in report upon report, these documents
merely going to swell the mountain of waste paper
which is allowed to accumulate in the bureaux. The
governor himself, in whom it was hoped reliance
might be placed, is obliged to admit that it is one
thing to promise and another to perform. So far as
regards finance, a beginning has yet to be made, and
to quote the opinion put forward by a colonial
councillor, M. Gareesie, in the course of his speech
upon the loan of four millions sterling : "The remedy
for our present evils and for our very critical financial
position, consists mainly in the cessation of the
anarchy which pervades the whole administration, and
in the constant efforts of our deputies to obtain places
for their proteges from the Foreign and Colonial offices
in Paris." It is worth reading from beginning to end,
<!-- Leaf 74, Page: 58 -->
of the river between Yen-Bai and Laokay. They,
too, will soon be commenced, and what with the trade
with Yunnan and the cultivation of cotton, which
may lead to the erection of factories, their importance
will be increased to no small degree.


Apart from the coal-fields, there are not, so far, any
important mineral workings, though a few seams of
antimony yield a metal the price of which has
increased since it has been introduced into the
composition of bullets. Close to the sea and to depots of
chlorate of sodium, sulphate of antimony might,
perhaps, be utilized to greater advantage in a
manufactory of soap, candles and other like products, for
sulphuric acid might be extracted from it, and a
factory of this kind would probably realize large
profits upon the Chinese coast, but a considerable capital
would be required to wash it.


The silver mines paid the Hue treasury an annual
tribute of over £120, and among them mav be
mentioned the Ngan-Son (Silver Mountain) in the province
of Cao-Bang, not far from Lake Babe. Conceded in
1889 to MM. de Saint Mathurin and Bedat, and
christened the Lucie mine, it was worked by them
and provided with European machinery, but the lack
of roads and the insecurity have, unfortunately, made
it very doubtful whether it will pay. Formerly the
Chinese worked in this mine, and they number many
very good miners, who, though devoid of scientific
principles, have become, by dint of experience, very
skilful in the difficult operation known as "
compellation," success in which involves a " handiness " which
they possess in an eminent degree. The owner of the
mine was in the habit of reserving six-sevenths of the
<!-- Leaf 303, Page: 287 -->
the Nam Ou; the former seem to have retained
something of the chill of the snows from the high
plateaux which gave them birth.


As soon as we are fairly in the Mekong, we stop on
the left bank for luncheon, near a small village hidden
among the cocoa-trees. A good road traverses it,
and leads to the pagoda; the women are working at
the cottou, carding it with a sort of small bow, spinning
and weaving it; the children impress me by the
fairness of their skin; a great many wear bracelets on
their feet. Hanging in the courtyard of the pagoda,
I notice a bell at least two yards long, made from the
hollow trunk of a tree, it is struck every morning
and evening.


While our men rest, we are carried to the right
bank of the stream, where there is a grotto in the
middle of a calcareous cliff; in front of the
openingthere is a kind of balustrade cut in the stone, and a
staircase leads to the celebrated sanctuary of Pakou,
already described by Gamier; here only one room is
found, and that is not very deep, but it is filled
with religious objects similar to those at Nam Ou;
and we have the same experiences as upon that clay,
for we can hardly step in the midst of this field of
gods for fear of crushing some of them with every
movement. I notice several banners, some floating and
others rolled up, most of them represent two divinities
standing upon lotus flowers; there is a small gilt
chest in the form of a tabernacle; and, higher
up, a bell in gilt plaster, a form derived from the
lotus bud; on the sides of the room are white
dragons with goggle eyes, showing their teeth. They
are of Chinese design, a man (all are in plaster)

  THE THBNG POST (DIEN BIEN FOU)
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P265_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 92, Page: 76 -->
Under Secretary of State for the Colonies replied
that he had been induced to take the initiative of
beginning the works without having consulted the
Chamber, owing to the urgent necessity for
revictualling troops in a distant outpost and transporting
so many soldiers.


With regard to this latter point, it might have been
objected that the carriages purchased are not suitable
for warm climates; and here again I must ask the
reader to consider the course which the English follow
in similar circumstances. So that, in justification of the
preference given to the plant selected over that of
other firms, it is difficult to invoke the strategical and
military interests at stake, for transport by it will
be slow in mountainous districts, while in the hot
season it would be dangerous for the health of the
troops.


Passing on from the criticisms to be made upon the
gauge and the selection of rolling stock, let us
consider for a moment the working of the line. The
Under Secretary said in the speech referred to, that
part of the line would be open in the beginning of
1891, and all the rest by the end of that year. We
are now well on into 1893, and this prediction has not
yet been fulfilled. It was stipulated in the contract
that before the opening of the works, the track of the
line should be made out by the Government engineer
with the contractor present while it was being done.


I believe that some preliminary survey was made,
but owing to the insecurity ofthe district, the poles and
other points de repere were in many cases destroyed.
Moreover, the survey was made in view of a
fortyinch gauge, so that it could not be applicable to one
<!-- Leaf 58, Page: 42 -->
China, so that he knows every nook and corner of the
coast quite as well as the pirates, whom he has often
circumvented. A good pilot is indispensable for
vessels of a certain tonnage, for the depth of water
varies very much, and navigation is often very
difficult.


Upon arrival, we remark, as at Haiphong, a few
white houses upon a hill of some altitude. The jetty
is not yet finished, nor has the railway been made.
The houses are of iron, and the cost of one with two
storeys is about 2,000 piastres.


A hearty welcome is given us by the chief
engineer, M. Portal, at whose house I make the
acquaintance of M. Georges Vlaveanos, who has just
brought the sloop Dupuis back from Hong-Kong. His
career has been a most extraordinary one.
Havingarrived at Bombay in 1857 on board a British vessel,
he fought against the rebels, and having come from
India to China, he took part in the campaign in 1860.
He afterwards commanded the Chinese troops against
the Taepings, and at Singang-Fou he met M. Dupuis
going all by himself into Yunnan. Last of all, we
find him in command of the " Yellow Flags" in
Tonkin.


AVe are in the very heart of the land of adventure,
and, to render the picture all the more complete, an
aged Annamite with a bronzed and wizened face,
wrinkled like a piece of parchment, insists upon
telling us his history. Chief of the boatmen in the
service of the Kebao Company, he has recently been
captured by pirates, and it was only after he had been
four days without food that he managed to escape by
swimming. His captors, he tells us, were commanded
<!-- Leaf 11, Page: VII -->
by way of Siam, I shall be certain of finding ready to
my hand fresh documents relating to the means and
the cost of transport, so being in a position to draw
a parallel, with figures to back it up, between the
different routes to the Laos.


In indicating the object I have in view, I shall
at the same time have let the reader see how
I have divided my narrative, commencing with
a brief reference to my arrival first in China
and then in Tonkin; of my sojourn in the
lowlands, of the crops which it is sought to cultivate,
of the mines which are being worked, and of the
budding industries. I will endeavour to set forth the
result of my inquiries as briefly as possible.


The second part, after I have referred to the ascent
of the Black River, will be devoted to my visit to
the Laos region, and if some documents of a purely
scientific character are passed over, the reader may
possibly be attracted by the description of Luang
Prabang, with its fine scenery, passable climate, and
bright and cheerful inhabitants.


I shall not be surprised if some of those who cast
their eyes over this preface treat me as an impostor,
because I put forward this glowing description of the
banks of the Mekong in order to disguise the
bitterness of the pill contained in the third and last part
of my book. For in this there is neither sunlight,
nor greenery, nor living waters, nothing but a mass
of black in the shape of figures, comparative tables,
prices, and distances. It is by arguments based upon
these figures that I would fain plead for an improved

After having spent several years in Tonkin, after
having been in Guiana, Senegal, and Madagascar,
Colonel Pennequin was last year placed in command
of the military territory which corresponds more or
less closely to the Black River. We soon find that
he is a very able administrator, and the results which
he has arrived at are truly surprising, for, all the way
up the river and even beyond the frontiers of the
Laos, we come upon traces of his handiwork, and
we are constantly learning from the native chiefs
themselves to appreciate him at his true value.


It is a piece of great good fortune for us to have
encountered him, as his perfect knowledge of the
country and of its inhabitants will greatly facilitate
our journey, and I am all the more desirous of
putting upon record how much I owe him, seeing
that during our stay here I was indebted to him for
<!-- Leaf 222, Page: 206 -->
obliged to skip the period of the conquest of Tonkin
by the French. Acting under Lu Vinh Phuoc's orders
Deo Van Tri took arms against us, and even fought
under the walls of Tuyen Quan as one of the enemy's
lieutenants. Now the war is over with us, with the
Siamese, and with the Chinese pirates, the districts of
Lai, Theng, and the sibsomchou-Thai are tranquil;
and, thanks to the skill of men like Pavie, Vacle, and
Pennequin, we have obtained, by peaceful measures,
not only the complete submission, but better still, the
the support, of Deo Van Tri and his relations. The
minister of the Emperor Hamghi, Tuyet, vainly tried
by promises and threats to entice the chiefs of Lai to
join him when he fled from our troops, and
endeavoured by forced marches to reach a refuge in China;
they allowed him to pass through the country, but
they would not follow him. At present, Deo Van Tri
tells me, he is at Canton, where he receives 300
piastres per month, raised for him in Tonkin by some
mandarin conspirators.1


The French Government has nominated Deo Van
Tri quan sou de Dien Bien, and pays him 100
piastres a month; his brothers, quan chau de Lai
and quan chau de Tuangiao, receive sixteen each.
These titles are only disguised excuses for giving them
a pension. In reality, Deo Van Tri is master of the
Upper Black River; his family (about four hundred
members) govern under him, and since the death of
his father he has absolute command over it. His


1 I said in a pamphlet (Une Excursion en Indo-Chine) that
recently the admissions of some captured pirates and some
papers that have been seized seemed to prove that Tuyet was
on the eastern frontier of Tonkin.
<!-- Leaf 50, Page: 34 -->

\"It is hereby declared that the coal mines in the
province of Quang-Yen, situated along the coast or
in the adjacent islands, shall only be disposed of by
tender."  
  
  
  Yet the arrangement come to was a private one.


I should be travelling out of my sphere were I to
attempt to get together all the materials for an
inquiry into the rights of the concession in the
Hong-Hay basin. This is by no means my
intention.1


I merely wished to explain to the reader how it
was that mines discovered in 1881 only began to be
worked in 1888, and that, so far from encouraging our
colonists, the administration seeks to throw difficulties
in their way, and I am certain, in spteaking thus, that
I shall find an echo among all those of our
compatriots who are attempting to carry out any project
in our extreme Eastern colonies. It is rendering a
service to the colonial cause to be as impartial as
possible; that is to say, to be as frank in denouncing errors
as in setting forth good results. The reader will
therefore forgive me if I point out the dark as well as the
bright side, and one of the reasons why the prosperity
of our colonies is so slow may be found in the
dilatory attitude of a red-tape administration.


Now, fortunately, the enterprise is in a fair way of
fulfilment, and at the head of it is a most able man,


1 I have had pointed out to me, and merely mention here, an
application for a concession of the coal-fields of Hong-Hay,
made in 1887 by M. Becope. It will be found fully explained, as
well as that of M. Bavier, in the letters from M. Biuourd to M.
Flourens, Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the Officiel of August
14, 1887.
<!-- Leaf 40, Page: 24 -->
voked, for some eloquent pleas in favour of free trade
have been made by M. Rolland, agent of the
Messageries Maritimes at Saigon, by members of the
Chamber of Commerce, and the Colonial Council of
that town. Nor have they been confined to
IndoChina, for the protest against protection duties has
come from La Reunion and other colonies.


{empty}M. de Lanessan, the present governor of Tonkin,
in a lecture before the Geographical Society, on Nov.
20th, 1887, has expounded the question at great
length, and the pith of what he says is as follows :—
\"What can you suppose that your factories at Rouen
and Roubaix can sell to such people as the Annamites,
who have not, one may say, any money in hand ? If
you want them to buy of us, instead of placing on them
custom duties which wrill prevent them from
procuring anything, even the commercial Chinese goods
which are subjected to excessive duties and the price
of which has been raised, ensure a wise and sensible
administration, and open up means of
communication."


These words appear to have been forgotten, for
their author, in a speech at the Haiphong Club in
July ot last year, pointed out that, despite the custom
duties, Tonkin was developing and its trade
increasing daily. In proof of this, he quoted figures showing
that the imports had gone up from £760,000 in 1890
to a million in 1891, the French imports being
represented by a third of this increase. But we may fairly
ask what figures would have beeu attained if only
trade had been free. But, putting upon one side a
momentary gain, there is the future of the colony,
and it must not be forgotten, to quote M. de Lanessan
<!-- Leaf 245, Page: 229 -->
him to Hanoi" (Cho-Ken pas bon, faire dive"
Hanoi).


As we are now weeding our troop, I do not
hesitate to dismiss another rather useless member.
Baptiste is paid, and moreover he is content for
he begins to find his profession rather tiring, and
has discovered a source of wealth, which is more
easily earned, by trading with the Meos. I wish him
a safe return and good luck; and determine to manage
without replacing him. Thou declares he is as good
a cook as he is major-domo, and for the banquets that
we are likely to make we do not require a great
culinary artist.


Before starting again, we say good-bye to Deo Van
Tri. Our intercourse with him has been most amicable
during all our stay at Laichau, and now he offers us a
complete collection of the costumes of the country,
in return I present him with a large bore rifle for
elephant shooting. M. Pavie had told me that the
chief has long wished for one, and I found that the
gift was received with much pleasure. Thanks to
the letters we brought to him, and to the
recommendations of his friends, we have found every
possible assistance provided for us by the Thou of
Laichau. He has given us all the information we
have wished for, and has answered all our questions
with the greatest kindness.


Every one is well informed respecting the fauna of
the country, for here every one hunts. AVe are told
that elephants are numerous at a week's march from
Lai, towards Poufang. The wild cattle, with short
yellow hair,1 are very dangerous; last year two  
  
  
  1 Probably the Bos gaurus.
<!-- Leaf 378, Page: 362 -->

AVith the tide of commerce setting eastward, trade
with Xieng Mai, which is at present carried on
overland by elephant caravans, passing through the
principality of Nan, or to Thareua (eight days above
Luang Prabang), and thence by rafts on the Mekong,
will be considerably reduced, the rate of transport
is not very high, but articles which have already
travelled a considerable distance to reach Xieng Mai,
have cost so much that they cannot rival with the
stocks in depot at Tourane.


As to trade with the north, with the Sibsompanas
and with China, it is already falling off. AVe find
here, upon a smaller scale, the same phenomenon
which in Tonkin has been one of the causes of the
check in commercial transactions with adjoining
provinces; the opium monopoly has been set up in
Luang Prabang by the Siamese. Not content with
having, during the past century, ruined and
depopulated the valley of the Mekong, and with weighing it
down with taxation, they now seem anxious to crush
its trade and arrest its growth. From our point of
view, it is a matter of indifference to us if the
relations between Luang Prabang and China become less
close and friendly, and we may even turn this change
to our profit, for the caravans which were w-ont to bring
opium clown the routes parallel with the Mekong, will
find it answer their purpose to branch off in the
direction of the Black River, and to effect their
exchanges with Upper Tonkin.


I can answer for the fact that during the past year
only one caravan reached Luang Prabang from the
north, this consisting of sixty mules from Xieng
<!-- Leaf 438, Page: 422 -->

I know what the answer will be. "It is easy, ' I
shall be told, " to talk about plans and intentions.
We are not short of them, what we want is capital."


Yes; money, the primary element of every
undertaking, is lacking. And yet the few Companies formed
to develop the resources of Indo-China have founded
a bank, the statutes and regulations of which are
soexacting that it cannot furnish any really efficacious
and practical aid even to those enterprises which it
may approve. The Bank of Indo-China admits
that its regulations do not allow it to play in our
colonies any such part as that of the English banks
in China.


\"The very slightest effort we may make to do
business," said one of its clerks to me, "obliges us to
twist and turn our regulations inside out. and even,
when the business is under w-ay, it is rarely according
to the absolute letter of the law."


Why are our capitalists so timorous ? AVhy do we
put some hundreds of millions of francs into such
enterprises as Panama, promoted by discredited
financiers or dishonest politicians, and nothing into
affairs at home ? This is an economic question, the
very complex causes of w-hich it is not for me to try
to discover here.


May I only be permitted, in finishing this work to
express the hopes which, it appears to me, are its
material conclusions.


The creation of a deep-water port at Hongltay or
Kebao.


A careful survey, to be followed by excavation,

between two evils it was necessary to choose the
lesser.


Another difficulty arises from the engagement of
coolies, as they may be summoned at any moment for
task-work in their villages, and there is a risk of being
short of hands just when they are most needed. This
drawback might be obviated by creating a village at
Hong-Hay, the inhabitants of which would be

registered for task-work. These few instances will

O

serve to show what a variety of fresh questions arise
each day, the solution of which can only be left to
time and experience. They are, however, mere
questions of detail, and do not in the least affect the
magnitude of the enterprise which, in four years, with an
outlay of £240,000 and by dint of indomitable energy,
has reached the pitch of prosperity at which we
already find it.


The Kebao Coal-fields.—An afternoon spent at
Kebao does not admit of much being said; but I must
just refer to an enterprise which, though small, is
essentially French, and which is being worked by French
capital. It has been started much more recently
than that at Hong-Hay, and much less money has
been spent upon it, so that the work is not nearly so
advanced.


The journey there takes not quite five hours through
the archipelago of Fitz-along, which is quite equal, in
regard to grandeur and majesty, to that of Along.
Our sloop is under the charge of an old French pilot,
well known at Haiphong and wearing a decoration
bestowed on him by the late Admiral Courbet, whose
familiarity with these waters has enabled him to be of
great service. He has been twenty-five years in

Cochinwho shall pay. Filled with officers, residents and
tradesmen, the Cafe is not frequented by the principal
officials and the administrative aristocracy of Hanoi,
for there is one class here quite above the rest, as is
inevitably the case even in a free country. As a general
rule, concord prevafls, gossip is very rare, and
illnatured remarks little listened to, the French
inhabitants of Hanoi not having yet come to loggerheads
among one another after the fashion of journalists, and
of journalists and soldiers, as gathered from the last
papers received from Paris. The regime of favouritism
and the fear entertained by the Government for the
press has not yet lighted that spirit of discord, the
effects of which we have to deplore so often at home.
Quiet as it was at the time of my visit, French society
in Tonkin would form an interesting study, for a
colony is, in reality, like a mirror which reflects the
mother country, accentuating the features, stripping
off the disguises and bringing the individual
characteristics into relief. In short, a colony exhibits in a
somewhat exaggerated form the defects as well as the
qualities. Nothing can be more instructive than the
study of a system of colonization, not only in regard
to the benefit conferred upon the conquered country,
but in respect to the relations which exist among the
newcomers.


It is impossible, howrever, for me to indulge in any
observations upon this head, as my feelings of
gratitude towards the many people who extended to me
a cordial welcome prevent me from saying anything,
even from the not very enviable standpoint of the
psychologist. Moreover, if I had gone into this
subject, I should have remained in Hanoi so long and

silk, beneath which the king is seated and is taking
tea, while the bonzes are reciting prayers inside.
The same dances described above are again performed,
with the addition this time of a third figure, viz.,
that of a dragon with a golden head and jaws like a
crocodile, the body being formed of material which
has a blue stripe down the middle of the back. There
are two men inside, and the monster, which goes
through the most extraordinary contortions, is called
Tsinng (the lion).


The orchestra is reinforced by flute players, their
instrument consisting of a simple bamboo cane
pierced with holes and having at one end a notch
upon which the player rests his upper lip.


Men of the king's household bear swords, the
sheath of which is of chased gold, while the handle
is of horn studded with precious stones. These
swords are over 200 years old, and very fine, but the
blade is common. Others carry lances with wooden
shafts and silver bands at the top, the iron of the
lance being encased in a red sheath. I also notice a
javelin, the iron of which is crescent shaped with a
notch at the lower end.


The king comes and greets us after he has taken
his tea; he seems to be amiable and intelligent, but,
as at all our other interviews, timid and ill at
ease, especially with the Siamese Colonel upon the
one side and us upon the other. As soon as our
audience is over, he ascends the small wooden
construction over which the water conduit is placed, and
his servitors bring him one after the other several
jugs of water which he pours into it and which
trickle down, drop by drop, upon a Buddha placed on

again, "that if the administration is, as I fear, above
all things bent upon obtaining money for itself, it is
certain to ruin Indo-China, without profit either for
the treasury whom it hoped to enrich or for French
industry."


Whatever may be the errors of the mother country,
they have not, however, entirely prevented the trade
of Haiphong from developing or the town from
increasing in size. Since my previous visit, two
years before, there have been many changes. New
streets have been made, fresh houses built, and
marshy pools filled in. Plenty of work is being
energetically carried on, and the general tone is better
than when I was last here, while business transactions
appear to be on the increase and a spirit of confidence
to have been engendered, this being in striking
contrast to the despondency which prevailed in view of
the many difficulties and the lack of support tendered
by the mother country. The loan has been voted,
the new governor has enunciated his programme, his
books have been read and his speeches listened to, and
it is hoped that he will be true to his promises—such
at least were the impressions which I derived from
conversations with various people. Good news is also
to hand with regard to my proposed journey, letters
from friends informing me that they have succeeded
in engaging some good " boys," while I hear from the
Black River that the district is fairly quiet, and that
I shall be able to move about without any escort,


All that I have to do therefore is to go up to Hanoi
and make my final preparations before starting upon
my expedition.  
  
  
  But, before penetrating inland, I am anxious to

  March 17th.


AVe start again with fresh coolies, who are recruited
without difficulty and do not cause us any delay, for
the chief had assembled the men on the previous
evening.


AVe pass through some more woods as we ascend
the valley of the Nam Meuc, during one part of the
day. At the entrance of Muong Poune, the village
where we sleep, I notice a wooden gateway like
those we have already seen; near it, upon a small board
raised upon bamboo posts, stand some tiny baskets
containing rice and provisions offered to the spirits;
and around it some small straw covered chapels, contain
sticks of perfume; in one of them I see a Roman cross.


Before dinner, we make our usual shooting
expedition, and whilst walking by the river side we
are surprised to see, at a turning of the road, two
short very bronzed individuals, wearing white
European clothes, trousers, jackets with copper
buttons, helmets and slippers. Our astonishment
only increases when we hear ourselves greeted in
good French, but we soon enter into conversation,
and the mystery is explained. We have met two
of the Cambodian interpreters from Luang Prabang
that M. Massie has sent from Dien Bien Fou to meet
us, but we only keep one of them, Takiate; the
other, Tchioume, is not well, and he is going to Van
Bou to see a doctor and nurse himself. As he
complains of suffocation, I give him some anti-asthmatic
cigarettes, which relieve him. AVith a letter from
{empty}M. Massie, Takiate brings us good news for the
continuation of our journey; some boats have been
<!-- Leaf 283, Page: 267 -->
ence in the civilisations, or to a change in the customs
produced by different religious ideas ? Psychology
must answer the question. I can only state the facts
that I have seen.


We start about five o'clock. The declining sun
brightens the landscape and enlarges the shadows.
The Siamese houses look cheerful and gay amongst
the green palm trees; behind them the broken
fantastic outline of the well-wooded mountains is
clearly defined against the horizon; one might
suppose them to be gigantic ruins overrun with
brushwood, and in the foreground on the river banks
the perpetual movement of men and women going to
and fro, attending to their daily work, animates the
landscape. One turn and the picture vanishes as by
magic, leaving in my mind an impression of gaiety
and freshness which I retain for a long time.


Below Muono-Ngoi the river widens to 100 or 150
yards in breadth. In the narrower places some
fishing traps have been erected: some bundles of three
posts each are tied together at the top forming a
faggot, in the centre is a basket full of stones, their
weight keeping them in place. Between one bundle
and the next a triangular net is placed, point in
front; a man raises it by means of a long pole, which
acts as a lever; when at work the fisherman squats,
head downwards, upon a small terrace formed of
bamboos. Several have covered their heads with a
red veil, and their position reminds me of Mussulmans
at their prayers. Here they are watching the water,
and when a fish is caught they suddenly raise the net.
I have sometimes counted seven or eight terraces
across the river.

a gilt chair in an adjoining building. After a few
more prayers in the pagoda, he returns home,
preceded by his courtiers, who are dressed in the Laos
fashion, like the rest of the people, without any
distinguishing sign, and who carry cups, boxes, a
teapot, and other articles all of wrought gold, and most
of them given by the King of Siam. It is surprising
to notice side by side with these a small yellow
tin box containing clothes, a French deal box,
painted to represent carriages and horses, a phial
containing scent, and a crystal bottle such as one may
see in a hairdresser's shop>. All this is indicative of
what must happen in a country which is overrun, as
this one will be, by the bad taste of what I may call
a cheap and nasty civilisation. Every one kneels in
the dust as the monarch passes by, behind him
beingfour bearers of parasols, two white and two green. The
cortege is a lengthy one, being headed by a group of
horsemen, bare legged, and with their toes resting upon
the edge of very broad stirrups; their dress consisting
of a small white jacket and a broad brimmed felt hat.
Then comes a mandarin in a wooden palanquin, upon
each side of him being a man who carries a bamboo
mat to protect him from the mud which the young
girls endeavour to throw- at him. A troop of children
who come along clapping their hands are succeeded
by two broad-wheeled waggons, one of which is drawn
by a horse, and the other by men, and by three
elephants conveying in a howdah, made of osier to
protect them from the sun, officers of a lower grade.
Behind them, with the Laos soldiers, preceded by six
trumpeters, comes the guard dressed in yellow tick
and wearing round caps, striped blue and white. The
<!-- Leaf 330, Page: 314 -->
his superior can release him from them upon the
request of his relatives and after the performance of
certain formalities. This, however, is a rare occurrence.
The great development of the Buddhist creed does not
prevent superstitions of another order from
beingprevalent among the multitude, superstitions the trace
of which is easily followed at the great festivals that
always appertain to ancient traditions or to the dread
of evil spirits. Diseases are regarded in the light of
persons, and when the cholera made its appearance
here last year, one of the mandarins went round the
town at the head of a squad of soldiers who executed
discharges of musketry at the gates to drive away the
enemy. But the native chief was not rewarded for
his zeal, as two days after, as the story goes, the
cholera appeared to him in a dream and reproached
him for trying to drive it away, saying that in coining
to Luang Prabang it was simply doing its duty.
As a punishment for his conduct, the cholera
announced to him his approaching death, and when the
mandarin woke up he was so terrified by the dream
that he fell ill and died three days afterwards.


In addition to the respect felt for spirits, it
would seem as if the worship of nature and its
forces is still preserved, for honour is paid to the
moon, the women going about the streets shouting
at each change of quarter. Guns and salvoes
are also fired during the eclipses, at which periods
the people say that " the moon is eaten up," without
seeking for any other explanation of the
phenomenon.


The truth is that they have not much learning,
these Laotians, despite the religious instruction

  PREFACE


An introduction or a preface to a book generally
aims at giving the reader a notion of what the author
has in view. In this case, the title of the work is
amply sufficient to indicate my intentions, and in
giving a narrative of my brief voyage from Tonkin
to Siam, I am desirous of simply relating what I saw
and how I came to see it, following the order indicated
by my itinerary.


A book, however modest may be its dimensions or
aim, is more or less of a creation, the plan being the
skeleton upon which the muscles and flesh come to be
laid. These latter give the shape, the beauty, and
the elegance, but the bony frame is none the less the
essence of the work. In the present case, my skeleton
is not difficult to discover, consisting of the principal
lines followed by me in my journey. I should not
have referred to this had I not hoped, by asking the
reader's help in the construction of it, to quicken his
interest in the completion. Possibly, after he has
edified and invigorated the skeleton himself, he will
find more pleasure in beholding it covered with
<!-- Leaf 269, Page: 253 -->
infancy; Here the sergeant has taught them to play
at ball and puss in the corner, and these games amuse
them very much; but in spite of the education which
they are receiving, they retain certain hereditary
characteristics inherent in their race. The present
pupils are all sons of chiefs; a young peasant was
admitted amongst them, but the sergeant was obliged
to send him away, for his aristocratic companions
kept him in quarantine.


In itself an administrative and intellectual centre
the post of Dien Bien Fou, also serves to unite Luang
Prabang with Tonkin, for through it pass all the mone)r
destined to pay the salaries of M. Massie and the
Consulate staff, some provisions and the letter-carriers;
two interpreters take it in turns to travel between
Dien Bien and Luang Prabang, and an escort
accompanies them to the rivers.


AA7e shall follow the same track, but only after the
lapse of a few days; in fact, we have to wait until our
coolies are assembled. Our delay is not lost time, we
have plenty to do besides the notes we wish to make,
and the days pass always quickly when Frenchmen
meet together so far from home. The neighbourhood is
full of game, and peacocks are very plentiful; we set
some traps, but do not catch anything; in the evenings
lighted by the moon we chat freely upon every
subject; distant fires illumine the plain; I wind up the
musical boxes that I have brought with me, and the
familiar airs of our native land give much pleasure to
those who have been so long away from their homes;
then a train arrives with some newspapers; the
lieutenant seats himself upon the front of one of the
boxes, we group ourselves in a circle round him,
<!-- Leaf 42, Page: 26 -->
avail myself of the invitation sent me to visit the
coalfields of Hong-Hay and Kebao, as it would be a
pity, at the cost of spending a few days more on the
coast, to let slip a second time the opportunity which
is offered me of seeing for myself the effort which has
already been expended upon what is the first and
perhaps the most important enterprise in the colony.
The Hong-Hay sloop Fanny comes to fetch us at
Haiphong, the windings of the canal when we get
out of the Cua-Cam river taking us through some
O O
lowlands, the greater part of which are inundated,
and which are covered with small marsh plants. After
we have been sailing for about two hours, the marshes
become less numerous, the ground becomes more hilly,
and the fields are under cultivation. A bridge thrown
over the stream and clumps of trees a few hundred
yards beyond mark the site of the town, residency
and post of Quang-Yen, which, owing to its coalfields,
will in due course become a much more important
place. Beyond this, rising above the ground, are
large rocks, which seem to have got quite out of their
element, for they look like so many marine monsters
which have been driven ashore in a storm and are
unable to get back into the water. They appear very
grotesque, but, in order to become grandiose, they
need the water to reflect them, and they would be
more in their place with their base in the ocean.


So we reach the entrance to the celebrated bay of
Halong, and I might as well put down my pen, for
it is very difficult to describe one of the finest sights
in the world, and so different from all others. Let
the reader try to imagine hundreds of islets, many of
which have the shape of gigantic pillars, surrounded
<!-- Leaf 228, Page: 212 -->
him I can travel anywhere, but without his protection
I should be stopped at Poufang. Now we have only
to secure some means of transport. The chief's mules
are at Ibang, where they have gone for tea; they will
not return for a fortnight. As soon as they arrive forty
of them will be placed at our disposal and we shall
only have the men to pay for. "You are a friend of
Vacle," adds Deo Van Tri; " I will lend you my mules;
you can keep them as long as you like. Take them to
Thibet, or to the sea if you wish; when you have
finished with them you have only to return them."


No one can make kinder proposals, so we decide to
wait for the return of the luggage mules, and utilize this
enforced delay by making an excursion to the high
table-lands which extend above Laichau. A cousin of
Deo Van Tri accompanies us and acts as our guide.
Camkoui, lituong of Lai, an old travelling companion
of M. Pavie as far as Manhao and Lao-Kay, is a fine
tall man, with a frank open face. He wears a white
Chinese dress, a turban and a pigtail. Amiable and
clear-headed, he knows a few words of French and
understands it readily; we are extremely pleased with him.
AVe have four small horses; three of them cost forty
piastres each, for the prices have risen in consequence of
an epidemic which broke out last year. One has been
given to me by Deo Van Tri; it is a white cob from
Mongtze belonging to the Yunnan breed. Well built,
with a broad chest, strong neck and shoulders and
small head, the race is very clever and strong for
mountain work. This is the only one that is shod.
Twelve coolies carry our luggage. The Thais decline
this work, which they consider beneath them; they
leave it to the Meos and Sas. The Sas, Xas, Chas,
<!-- Leaf 332, Page: 316 -->
intelligent Kas; it will be conquered or subjected by
some superior race. But the question w-ill then arise
whether it will have the force of character to lead a
life of servitude, working like the negritos whom it
has itself subjected; or whether it will fuse with its
conquerors, or gradually disappear.


In speaking of the inhabitants of the principality
of Luang Prabang, I referred to the Lus, the Meos
and the Chinese, and a few words must be said about
all three.


The first mentioned strike me as being, from an
ethnographical point of view, very similar to the
Laotians, whose language they speak, with a few slight
differences of dialect, but they are smaller, punier and
in a more poverty-stricken state. AVe saw one of
their villages, just behind Luang Prabang, and its
poverty was the most salient feature about it. Coming
originally from Sibsompanas, where they form the
principal element of the population, they have been
driven south by Chinese wars and invasions, and several
of them told me that they had not the means of
returning home. Moreover, they are just as well off where
they are, for, like the Kas, they cultivate the soil,
planting- rice fields for the Laotians. Their clothing is
very poor compared with that of the latter, the men
wearing short blue trousers and the women, striped
petticoats, the latter having their hair drawn up in a
chignon at the top of the head, covered in many
cases with a dark blue scarf, while both sexes wear a
loose blue vest.


The Meos live upon the eastern frontier of the
kingdom, close to the Pouons plateau. I never met
any in the town, but I had an opportunity of
<!-- Leaf 211, Page: 195 -->
village, Quinai,1 the chief town of the province; some
twenty houses are scattered amongst the trees, which
include some superb palms. Upon the beach some men
are keeping up a fire under the trunk of a hollow tree;
a pirogue is being made of a single piece, and it is
necessary to straighten the sides. There is an unusually
large number of people, for the chief is marrying one
of his sons and is giving a grand feast; men and
women from all the country-side have been invited.
The latter wear a small chemisette fastened by silver
hooks of rather delicate work; a handkerchief with
embroidered ends is arranged upon the head like those
worn by the Breton women; flowers are stuck in one
side of the hair. Some of the guests come from the
neighbouring hills or from the villages opposite; they
cross the river in long boats, which two men, one in
front and one at the back, guide with paddles.


The people sell us some provisions and give us
some information. A pirogue was shipwrecked five
days ago a little above here. It was manned by some
Chinese, who were bringing opium down to Van Yen;
one of the passengers was drowned, but there is no
reason for us to be alarmed for our boatmen are good,
and we have confidence in them, we therefore leave
without fear.  
  
  
  February 27th.


A few more villages in the morning and then we
enter a well-wooded and less populated district where
we pass several fishermen. One of them has built a
shelter on the small sandy beach; it is made of bamboos

hilly country. These are comparisons humiliating
to make, but I think that it is my duty to point out
the mischief in the hope of our being able to discover
the remedy.


I have endeavoured to show in as few words as
possible what has already been done in the way of
colonization, and when it is remembered that we have
only been in Tonkin seven or eight years, it may
fairly be said that we have effected a good deal;
though if we look at what the English and Dutch

O O
colonies bring in both to private individuals and the
State, we find that they are far in advance of us. Our
inferiority may be ascribed to two causes, the first of
which is often dependent upon the second: viz.
piracy and the administrative system.  
  
  
  PIRACY.


The country is not pacified, as might without any
feeling of humiliation be admitted by those in
authority, for it is not often that a colony is found
to be quiet immediately after it has been taken
possession of: Algeria and Burmah being very
striking illustrations of this. Moreover, in Tonkin, piracy
is an endemic disease, which existed long before
our presence there. The only thing is that when
the mother-country knows the exact state of the case,
it will be in a position to adopt the measures necessary
for reducing the evil; that is to say, it will make the
required sacrifice of men and money in order to put
an end to this state of things. If she does not do so,
she will be subjected to constant disappointments and
deceptions, eventually spending much more than
<!-- Leaf 126, Page: 110 -->

In the way of birds I come across some Euflocomas,
and M. Vacle tells me that he has seen specimens
of the celebrated and extremely rare Rheinart
pheasant, which appears to extend thus far, and a
promise is made to try and secure me one.


From all I can see and hear, and from what is told
me, the fauna of the surrounding mountains must be
full of interest, all the more so because it has not
been studied at all, and I am so eager to be at work.


So M. Vacle's proposal to make a few days' excursion,
pending the arrival of the canoes, is readily accepted,
Charles remaining behind to make collections with
Baptiste and Thou, who has already been initiated
into the secrets of butterfly catching.


Upon the morning of the 26th, M. Vacle, M.
Bounam his assistant, several " boys," two Annamite
interpreters, Yao and myself, pack ourselves as best
we can into a large sampan. Yao is a curious
character, who deserves a fewr words of introduction.
Let the reader imagine a little fellow, not more than
nine years of age, not much taller than a top boot,
very precocious, quick as lightning, and smoking like
a chimney, with a round intelligent head, surmounted
by an elegant red cap, and full of affection for his
second father (M. Vacle having purchased him for
16 piastres from the pirates of the highlands). Such
is Yao, who is as sharp as a monkey, and is of great
service to M. Vacle, notably as a spy. Already a
great traveller and talking- several languages without
being aware of it, our little friend hears all that is
said and repeats it to his master, but in what language
I have not yet been able to understand. But that is
of no consequence, the master and pupil understand
<!-- Leaf 375, Page: 359 -->
hand. I have read several articles in the Bangkok
Times to the effect that the French have great
facilities for getting into their hands all trade upon
the Mekong, and that to guard against this Siam
ought to push on the construction of railways with all
speed. Then, again, Mr. Macey and Captain Devrez
assert that the Tonkin routes are much shorter,
easier, and less expensive than those leading to
Bangkok.


AVhatever the truth may be, of one thing I can
speak positively, and that is that the greater part of
the commercial current of Luang Prabang either
comes from or goes to Bangkok. This current follows
one of two routes. It either proceeds from Luang
Prabang to Paklay by the Mekong; Paklay to
Pitchai or Ontaradit by land and from thence to
Bangkok down the Menam (this being the way by
which we returned), a voyage of twenty-six days
going down and fifty-two coining up. The second
route is from Luang Prabang to Nong Kay by the
Mekong; from Nong Kay to Korat and from Korat
to Bangkok, this being rather the longer of the
two. These routes, though shorter than that which
brings Luang Prabang and Tonquin within a month
of each other, have the advantage of being safer both
by water and by land, there being no rapids on the
Menam, while the roads are wide enough for elephants
to travel easily along them and might easily have
rails laid dowm. Owing to the facility of the
communications, the cost of transport between Luang
Prabang and Bangkok is if not cheaper, at all events
not dearer than those via the Black River, and as I
have been over the two routes myself I am in a
<!-- Leaf 226, Page: 210 -->
same way as in France, and seven or eight men hold
them, a few are only used as bloodhounds, to search
the wood. When the retreat of the deer is once
ascertained, the pack is thrown off upon the hill; the
chiefs ride and their servants follow on foot, while all
are armed with rifles, and they fire upon the animals
as soon as they can.


Hunting- is not considered incompatible with
mourning, which is worn and observed with the greatest
care. Deo Van Seng has been dead about three
months. AVe arrived too late to be present at the
funeral ceremonies, which, the sergeant tells us, were
very curious; bonzes were summoned from China, and
a great many sacrifices were made in honour of the
deceased. For more than a month one buffalo and
sometimes two were immolated daily; the animal was
suspended by its hind feet to a gallows sufficiently high to
prevent its fore feet from touching the ground. Each
member of the family had then the right to give it
a blow with a double-edged knife until at last they
cut its throat. Buffaloes, pigs, chickens and rice do
not cost the chief anything, for they are levied, like
the statute labour. Moreover, everything that is
productive here, that is harvested, produced or killed,
passes before Deo A^an Tri, and he retains the lion's
share; this is the feudal law, and no one seems to
complain of it. Even now provisions are daily
carried to the manes of the dead. His tomb is inclosed
in a bamboo hut, surrounded by a paling, and
ornamented with small flags. The scaffolding, which
we saw as we arrived, is on a platform above the rock,
which towers over the confluent of the two rivers and
the valley of the Song Bo. Deo A;an Seng will not
<!-- Leaf 346, Page: 330 -->
or Siam from the Gulf of Bengal. I am told a curious
story about one piece of money formerly coined in
the Principality of Nan; the legend is that a queen
who formerly ruled over the country, was so ugly that
she could not find any one to fall in love with her,
and that, in order to show that, however beautiful
their features may be, all women are alike, she had
a certain part of her body represented on this coin.


In the market, each vendor has his own special
stall, while the representatives of the same trade are
all placed together, and a tax of twenty-five cowries
is collected from each of them every morning by
soldiers told off for the purpose, whereas the street
hawkers are exempted from all dues. The market
occupies the principal artery of the town, with
numerous pagodas and palaces to the right and left,
one of those on the left being- Ouate Mai', ouate
being the word used in Laotian, Siamese, and
Burmese, to signify temple, while inai means new.
The pagoda itself is from 100 to 130 feet long by
fifty to seventy feet broad, with whitewashed walls
and a tile roof. The interior is very similar to that
of a Catholic church, with pictures on the walls
representing religious legends, and at the end an altar,
upon which are accumulated ornaments of all kinds
and statues of gods in every variety of pose, while in
the centre, as in all the other temples, is a golden
figure of Buddha seated, from seven to ten feet high.
The features are the same in all these statues of
Buddha, and, with his legs crossed, and his hands
resting upon his thigh, the statue which is more
the outcome of high strung religious feelings, and
represents the very spirit of the races which have

getting worse, the muddy colour of the water
indicating the rapidity with which the sand is
accumulating at the bar. Here, too, the banks are very
low, the ground on the left being made up of rice
fields or marshes intersected by small canals, the town
of Haiphong being on the right bank. With its
docks and shipbuilding yards, its small white houses,
many of them surrounded by greenery, its boulevards,
canal, and large hotel, surmounted by a dome, it affords
a strong contrast with what it was in 1886, when the
site, of what is now the town, consisted of a marshy
and unhealthy plain, amid which the few dry spots
were occupied by wretched mud-cabins. By dint of
energy, activity and perseverance, our compatriots
have, so to speak, drained the water out of the ground
and turned it off into the canals, they have dried the
soil and filled up the hollows with earth brought in
baskets by a whole army of coolies, while by draining
the marshes they have got rid of the fever which
gave such an evil repute to the site of the old town.
This is mainly due to the energy of M. Bonnal, the
late Resident, and the fact of there having been only
one death last year among the European population
of Haiphong testifies to the rapidity with which the
elements of a town have been evoked out of the mud.
It has surprised many English travellers, who are not,
as a rule, easily taken aback, and it is a proof the
more of our not being so devoid of the
colonisinocapacity as it is so often alleged that we are.


In spite of the works which have already been
carried out at Haiphong, its future is by no means
assured, and there is very little European trade there.
Large vessels cannot arrive there, only those with

<!-- Leaf 144, Page: 128 -->
oars are rarely employed, and they are rather short
and flat at the ends, not being lifted out of the water
when they are in use.


One canoe is occupied by myself and the interpreter,
the latter being a tall, thin Chinaman, with a pale
complexion and regular features, who is very
goodlooking and, as we are told, a great favourite with
the ladies. The new wife of Cho-Ken, as he is called,
was formerly an Annamite courtesan, and he has left
her at Cho-Bo, while he himself, formerly an
interpreter of Deo Van Tri, has come down to seek
employment at Hanoi, being for the present attached to
the commissary at Cho-Bo. Despite the repugnance
which I feel for the Chinese, I am glad to have got
leave to employ this one, not that I had much choice
in the matter, for our boys know only a few words of
the Thai tongue. Charles and Thou are in the
second canoe, while the three others convey the
baggage as well as Sao and Baptiste, the latter not
beingvery bright at present, and too much given to opium.
I do not, however, despair of making something of
him, and I have given him fair notice that if I catch
him smoking I shall destroy all his apparatus, and
to an opium smoker the loss of his pipe and lamp
is rank ruin.


In addition to our own convoy, another canoe
is occupied by M. Vacle and his interpreter, as he
is going to accompany us for several days, and
see us safe beyond a point reputed to be dangerous,
where the pirates often attack the boats as they go
through. Our boatmen relate how 300 Chinese,
former adherents of the Black Flag band, have just
made terms with the Doc-Ngu, and they say that
<!-- Leaf 77, Page: 61 -->
and a buffalo " would unquestionably be the socialistic
programme for Asia if its inhabitants were to be won
over by glib talk, instead of being firmly convinced
that the strong will continue to rob the weak as long
o O
as the world lasts. The crops are less abundant than
in Cochin-China, and yet in some years, such as 1891,
Tonkin has a surplus stock of rice to dispose of. The
sugar-cane and maize are also cultivated in the north
together with cinnamon, the bamboo, the cocoa-tree,
the mulberry, the betel-nut, indigo, the castor-bean,
etc.


The areca-nut requires comparatively little
attention, and it is a good plant to cultivate, assuring- an
annual return and enabling the grower to make
exO O
pertinents in cultivating other plants which will not
yield a profit for some years if at all. Among these
latter let me mention manilla jute and hemp, both
these plants, which yield a rich return in the
Philippine Islands, having recently been tried in some land
upon the left banks of the Red River conceded to
Messrs. Gobert.


Cotton is destined, in my opinion, to be the great
source of wealth in Tonkin, and there will be no
difficulty in sending it in its raw state to the Yunnan,
Quang-Si, and even as far as Setchuen.. If the figures
given by Mr. Bourne and by the French Consul at
Mung-Tse, upon the cotton trade in the Chinese
provinces which border on the French colony, are
carefully considered, and if account be taken of the
cost of transport by caravan of a bale from Burmah or
the Laos into the Chinese towns, it will be easy to see
what an enormous profit we may make by exporting
raw cotton on the Red River or by a railway when
<!-- Leaf 88, Page: 72 -->
  
  TRADE, ROADS, AND OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATION.


Trade ought unquestionably to have already
acquired much more importance than it has, but
I shall have to revert more in detail hereafter to
what I said about Haiphong in the previous
chapter when speaking of commercial outlets. For the
present I will confine myself to the means of
communication, first among which is the admirable
network of rivers and canals which the Messageries
Fluviales Company turns to such good account.
Something still remains to be done for improving
the upper courses of the rivers, but even if the
navigation is improved to the fullest possible extent
the water transports would not suffice, roads and
railways being also required. M. de Lanessan has
already put into execution the scheme which he
had propounded in his lectures, and in fifty days
he had nearly 200 miles of roads laid. Natives
were employed upon this work; and although they
were given the choice of executing the labour
themselves or of paying a fixed sum instead, not one
in ten preferred the second alternative. These
roads are thirty-six feet wide, raised above the
marshes, ready to take the tramway rails when these
are laid down. Though these works are distinctly
useful, they have been very severely criticised,
in proof of which I may quote the
followingletter from a very old settler in the colony :—


\"I was telling you about the roads, thirty-six feet
wide : nothing can be more deplorable. But that was
intended to create an effect in France, and the
<!-- Leaf 348, Page: 332 -->
adgive their lessons and recite their prayers. The
temples are public, and they who have no family
home are entitled to sleep in them, while upon
week days the people come to make offerings of
flowers, and perform libations with water, listening
to the advice given them by the priests, while the
women tell their beads, and signify that they have
got through them by blowing through a sea shell.


Outside the principal building, in the courtyard of
the pagoda, are a series of ongmong, or small buildings
which contain the statues ofthe gods; pyramids (Tate)
containing the bones of prominent bonzes or members
of the Eoyal Family, and plaster bells like the lotus
flower, behind all these buildings, hidden among the
trees, being the houses of the bonzes, whose pupils
we remark at play, the game at which they play,
with a hollow ball made out of bamboo canes twisted
together, being one which requires great skill.


After leaving Ouate Mai, we ascend the small hill
which commands a fine view of the town, about 350
feet above, and upon the summit of which are several
small buildings and a gilt belfry in which is hung a tam
tam about three feet in length. Several men keep
guard over it aud beat it to let the bonzes know
when it is the hour for study, or else an alarm bell in
case of fire. There is a grand view- from here, as the
city is at our feet, half hidden among the cocoa trees,
one part, which was burnt last year and has been
rebuilt, being less wooded than the others.


AVe collect some bivalve fossils as we come down,
half-way from the summit, being a covered terrace
with a building, inside which is a bath-shaped
cavity with five marks supposed to have been made
<!-- Leaf 389, Page: 373 -->
  
  She.—" Don't you hope to marry me ?"  
  
  
  The Chorus.—" It is sad to marry an old woman."


He.—" I cannot marry you now, but later on when
your husband is dead. You have a very pretty face,
pretty as the god in the centre of the pagoda, who is
so beautiful that I dare not look at him."


And he pretends to run away in terror. The
younggirls burst into laughter.


She.—-" At a small rivulet there is not very much
to drink."


He.—"Here are two candles. My face is well
lighted. Does it please you or not ? You must say."


She.—" I love you, and you don't love me. AVhom
am I to marry ? "


He.—" AVhen we die, we will die together; we shall
be burned together.''


She.—"AVhen the flames mount up you will leave
the young married woman."


He goes up to the group of girls, and lights them
with the candles, then returns to make love to the
old woman.


He.—" If you become my wife I will not abandon
you. I could not find any one so pretty as you."


She.—" AVe are going to bid you good-bye. If
you love me we shall meet again in a few days."


He.—"AVhen I go away from here I shall find no
girl so pretty as you. I shall die."


Upon this the party breaks up. AVe are guarded
during the night by a sentinel who, every quarter of
an hour answers by two strokes on a small gong the
strokes of the large one at the pagoda. It is the
garde d vous of our sentinels.
<!-- Leaf 278, Page: 262 -->
are so close together that at a distance they look like
drawers. Everything being on board and arranged,
the tricoloured flag is fastened to the stern and we
start on our way, descending with the current between
large forests, or woods of bamboos; the river is only
twenty to thirty yards wide and not very deep.
There are a great many rapids, and at the last, Hat Si
Long, we are obliged to take out the cases. AVe ship
some wrater, besides which, it is raining, so that we are
drenched from above as well as from below; we
therefore accept an offer from a Thai family encamped
upon a sand bank, who invite us to warm ourselves
at their fire. AAre begin to talk and find that our
hosts were forcibly deported from the plain of Dien
Bien, and that, after ten years' absence, they are
returning to their home. They have a pirogue and
a raft made of bamboos tied together, which carries
their animals, fowds and pigs; we leave them after
buying- some cocoa-nuts which they have brought
from the south. A little further on, the Nam Nona
joins the Nam Ou, the new river, which is about forty
yards wide, flows rapidly between sloping banks
covered with woods and brushwood. AVe stop for the
night, a little below the confluent, at a small sand
bank on the right. It is advisable to sleep on land so
that our clothes may be dried at a fire, but in spite
of our improvised shelters, the night is bad, rain falls
perpetually, and we are kept awake by myriads of
small mosquitoes, which are none the less vicious
because they are silent. Our men lie down upon
mats and this evinces a more advanced stao-e of
civilisation than we have found amongst the Thais;
in the middle of the night they suddenly jump up,
<!-- Leaf 345, Page: 329 -->
from the North or the South. From China come
opium, musk, tea, vermicelli, and the felt carpets with
a white pattern which are brought from Tali, and
which I had seen before when travelling in Thibet;
O 7
from Burmah green and red boxes of lacker work such
as one sees in India; from Bangkok and Xieng Mai"
European shoddy goods, muslins and stuffs, red silks
with the mark, " Manufactured in Lyons, France,"
with calicoes sold for about sixpence a yard, imitation
jewellery, sleeve links, garters, thread, needles,
Japanese matches (sold for fourpence or fivepence per ten
boxes), scribbling paper, condensed milk and a host
of other articles, all either of English or of German
make, the only French articles which I came across
are a few bottles of ink and buttons.


As said before, it is the Chinese who import and
sell the goods from Siam or the AVestern Shan States,
there being four traders in European articles. One of
these is a French protege, who tells me that he has
brought his stock of goods from Bangkok by Pitchai.
AVhen he goes down, he takes with him from Luang
Prabang ivory, for which he pays about 5s. a pound,
and benzoin which costs him about a rupee per lb.
Last year, the price of these articles was very nearly
double, and the trader tells me that a pair of fine
stag's horns is worth about thirty rupees, a smaller
pair fetching a third of that price. He adds that
business is very bad, and that it is as much as he can
do to make both ends meet.


The money in circulation is the English rupee, the
Siamese tical, the piastre, native coins in copper and
silver, shaped like canoes, and cowries strung together
like chaplets, these latter coming by way of Burmah
<!-- Leaf 361, Page: 345 -->
birds in cages, which it is considered to be a very
meritorious act to purchase and let loose. This Laos
custom is very general among the Buddhists, and I
remember seeing at Batang a Chinese soldier who, as
he caught his fish, put them iuto a bucketful of
water, the Thibetans giving him money at the close
of the day to put them back into the river.


I notice also some iguanas, the flesh of which is
said to be excellent, but they are so quick in their
movements that they can only be caught by clogs
trained to the work. Flowers, including piles of
gardenias picked in the gardens, four varieties of
orchid and red and white flowers from different trees,
are also bought in large quantities for the decoration
of the pagodas, and at the stalls set up in the open
is sold vermicelli cooked wdth grasshoppers, a small
bag made out of banana leaves answering the purpose
of a cup. As in Tonkin and Japan, at the boys' fete,
many people carry paper bags made to imitate fish,
while streamers with designs of animals upon them
are used for certain games.


There is great animation in the streets, nearly all
the inhabitants finding their way into the main
thoroughfares, shouting, buying, discussing, eating,
and smoking until the religious ceremony begins.
The bonzes have brought into the open all their gods,
excepting the large statue at the further end of the
pagoda, and proceed to put them through their
toilet. The women, in the meanwhile, are visiting
the pagodas, the general rule being to go to those
situated in another parish to that to which they
belong. The evening is spent in shouting and singing,
like the last.

against those who have ruined them. The peasants
bow the head in subjection because they see no
liberator; but the first man who comes forward with
some arms and a relatively small sum of money, in
order to drive out the Siamese, may be assured of
encountering an enthusiastic and almost unanimous
welcome from the population.


AVhat a grand opportunity for us to come forward
as protectors of the rights of Annam, and as
champions of freedom ! Many travellers and ardent
colonists have appreciated this, and it is unnecessary
for me to recur to the efforts of all the explorers who
have traversed these regions, from the time of the
Lagrene" Mission to that of M. Pavie, including those
of Harmand, Neis, Taupin, etc., or to speak of the
encouragements given by M. le Myre de Vilers, who
created the Vice-Consulate at Luang Prabang or of
the warnings of Monseigneur Pugenier as to the
intrigues of Siam upon the banks of the Mekong.
I should have at the same time to dwell upon the
divergent directions of our external policy in the
Far East and upon the humiliating and fatal motto
imposed upon our representatives, "Don'tlet us have
any bother (p>as d'affaires)."


I should have to point, on the one hand, in Indo
China, to intelligent, courageous and persistent
individual efforts, encouraged in some cases by personages
of mark, and, upon the other hand, to the timidity,
the prudence, not to say the careless or even ignorant
apathy of the Foreign Office in Paris.


AVere it not for my desire to avoid wearying my
readers, I would quote at greater length from M.
Gamier, whose conclusions, after a lapse of twenty
<!-- Leaf 78, Page: 62 -->
one is made. But I will revert to this subject when
dealing with the commercial outlets of Tonkin.
O


Some of the cotton will, perhaps, be manufactured
in the colony, while the rest is exported raw, and
there is no reason why the cotton-spinning factories of
Tonkin should not become very important. Take,
for instance, India, where cotton is grown and spun,
the materials thus made being sent as far as China,
though the manufacturers have to use coal, which is
very expensive, seeing that it comes all the way from
England or Japan. Yet in Tonkin we have both the
raw material and the combustible, and there can be
no reason why the cotton factories should not be built
in districts where the coal abounds. The companies
which have obtained concessions for working the coal
are, therefore, in every way interested in creating at
the same time agricultural establishments. This
combination seems to be understood by many of the
colonists, and M. Marty, among others, is about to
establish a large cotton factory in the neighbourhood
of Yen Bay.


The climate is admirably adapted to the
cottonplant, and in the Thanhoa and Bay-Sai districts it
attains full growth in four months, while upon the
high tablelands the Muongs sow it and leave it to
grow without any further attention, gathering it when
ripe as they require it.


Experiments with plants from Georgia have been
made near Hanoi by an Anglo-French company, and
the unsatisfactory results thus far obtained may be
due to bad management and the lack of proper
preparation.  
  
  
  The failure of a concession obtained by M.
<!-- Leaf 105, Page: 89 -->
Bourgets only £240 ? Then there is the constant shifting
of residents, some localities having had as many as
five in the twelvemonth.


I do not wish to be taken for a pamphleteer, but I
would advise any readers who may wish to get to the
bottom of the matter to peruse the Tonkin papers or
to have a talk with some colonist. I have had many
opportunities of making an investigation ofthis kind,
and for my own part I know wTell what to think of
the administrative system, and in many cases it is
the pirates who undertake to familiarize us with it.


If it was not known wdiat changes need be made
in the recruiting and organization of the staff, there
would be some excuse, but several of them have been
pointed out; and M. Harmand, in his translation of
British India and in the preface which precedes it,
like M. Chailley-Bert in his work upon English
colonization, show7s us what our rivals are capable of.
They succeed, and why should we not imitate them ?
for there is nothing undignified in borrowing what is
good from our enemies, like the Romans who conquered
the world by following up that maxim.


This does not imply that none of our civil
functionaries in Tonkin are well instructed or experienced.
Upon the contrary, they comprise many men of high
worth, but the constant changes to which they are
subjected and the limits within which their activity
is confined does not admit of their giving the country
the benefit of their good qualities, as they might do
on other conditions.


Above all, it is incumbent that Tonkin should not
be regarded as a place for shooting rubbish and for
providing posts for all the proteges of influential
<!-- Leaf 316, Page: 300 -->
Sena is a sort of House of Peers possessing the right
of remonstrance. In fact, the Governmental acts
bear the preamble, " The Sena and the King," the
former being given precedence.


The administrative functionaries and the judges are
appointed by the king, subject to the approval of
the Siamese Commissioner. Justice is administered
according to the traditions of what was known in the
early ages as "the judgments of God." That is to
say the oath is taken upon a silver cup or a sword,
and hoby water is given the accused to drink, and if the
accused person has wrongly declared himself innocent
the water will poison him or the sword will be thrust
through him by a spirit, at night. It need hardly be
said that the judges are not satisfied with this test,
that is to say, they take care to inform themselves
before the trial as to the fortune of the prisoner, and
it is said that they are easily influenced by bribes.


The punishments comprise fines, the bastonade, penal
servitude, and being put in chains, but torture is not
practised. In addition to the forced labour, there is,
as already stated, the capitation tax, the opium tax,
and the monopoly of the tchoum-tchoum, but the
monopoly of gaming, which is the source of large
revenue in Siam itself, has been suppressed here
by the Siamese as being immoral. It is the same
with the speculation upon the money exchange, which
is not yet resorted to in Luang Prabang. In the
valley of Menam, more especially, the money in use
is composed of earthenware counters, the circulation
of which is suspended or the value altered by a
Government decree, large profits being thus secured
in very arbitrary fashion. Another source of profit

busts draped in gold-thread scarves of native make.
Opposite them a dozen young men take their places.
A man carrying a Laotian organ, which he has
difficulty in setting up, follows them. The pipes of
the organ are so long—nearly 14 feet—that he is
finally obliged to cut a hole in the roof, but the
damage can be easily repaired.


AVe are about to assist at a good game of repartee,
between the men and the women, a sort of literary
joust.


Each camp has its champion. On one side a
youngman, with a rather expressive face, contorts his facial
muscles so as to produce every sort of mimicry.
Opposite is an old woman with a wrinkled and
pockmarked skin, though her ugliness does not prevent her,
from possessing the gift of quick retort. The organ
plays continually on a grave key in a sort of bass,
while the persons present accompany it by
clappingtheir hands at certain measures.


AVhen the woman rejects her questioner's
propositions, the latter takes two small candles, made of a
little wax coiled round a few threads, holds them fixed
with the thumb nail, and gesticulates, turning his
hands and moving his arms in passes like those of a
hypnotiser. To these movements correspond certain
shruggings of the shoulders, contractions of the
mouth, distortions of the nose, and wrigglings in
consonance with the measure of the organ music. AVhen
the grimaces are funny the women mark their
satisfaction by bursting into peals of laughter.


Of the group of young men some interrupt to
support or excite their champion, or they repeat a
refrain in chorus. It is generally some popular phrase,.

had so much to write that I should not have got any
further.


After a stay of ten days, our preparations are
completed, and as the first part of our expedition is to be
by water, we are not obliged to be very particular as
to the quantity of our luggage. By the advice of
{empty}M. Pavie, we have had made several small wooden
cases covered with sheeting, the weight of which, when
filled, will not exceed 56 lbs. This division of the
baggage into small parts is necessary in view of their
being eventually carried by porters. They contain
preserved meats and fruits which will be used more for
presents at the different stations than for our own
consumption; ammunition, such as powder, shot and
cartridges, and presents which are intended for the
chiefs and also to be used as articles of exchange, these
consisting chiefly of musical boxes, photographs, and
pictures, purses, watches, alarums, needles,
lookingglasses, and many other " articles de Paris," worth
in all about £10. Our weapons comprise a No. 8
rifle in case of our getting a shot at an elephant,
a 450 rifle, two Winchesters, two No. 12 rifles, and
a gun for shooting small birds.


Our clothes do not take up much room, consisting
of a few flannel shirts, a woollen coat, linen trousers
and vests, and porpoise-skin boots, which latter I
recommend as being waterproof, strong, and very
supple. Our general head-dress is a sun-helmet.


We had to buy at Hanoi some stores and
indispensable instruments, such as sugar, tea, coffee, and
cooking utensils—if such a title can be given to a
few saucepans and kettles. As far as our individual
wants are concerned, we have confined ourselves to
<!-- Leaf 259, Page: 243 -->
obtained for us on the Nam-Ou. AA^e are lucky in
not losing much time.  
  
  
  March \8th.


After some hours' march through the woods we
descend, to pass into an immense open unwooded plain,
which extends as far as we can see; in the distance
some low hills surround it by a faint bluish line, which
scarcely rises above the horizon. The plain of Theng
is about eighteen miles long and very fertile; it was
once well cultivated and supported a numerous
population (100,000 souls according to Deo A^an Tri).
Perhaps the number has been exaggerated, but it
is certain that the country has been completely
depopulated by the Siamese. Following their usual
policy, they deported the inhabitants to the distant
regions of the Nenam, ruining this country for the
advantage of their own kingdom. They took 12,000
Thais from Theng and sent them to Bangkok. A
great many of them stopped on the way, and their
restoration to their own country is one of those
useful works to which M. Massie is devoting himself,
even spending- a portion of his own salary upon it.
In one year he has more than quadrupled the
population of the plain, and the number of houses in the
village of Theng has increased from four or five to
twenty-seven.


This depopulation and the waste of all this good
land, which has fallen out of cultivation in
consequence, are sufficient to recall to our minds the
ravages of the Siamese, if they had left no other
traces of their passage. The southern portion of the
plain is bristling with small round hillocks, of which  
  
  
  it 2
<!-- Leaf 416, Page: 400 -->
abundant. Once the question of natural, and
especially artificial, obstacles which have to be met on
Chinese territory in order to penetrate into Yunnam
is perfectly understood, the construction of a railwav
line from the sea to Lao Kai may be dealt with within
six months at the longest, and without the slightest
danger of failure."


A minute study of the question of a railway from
the coast to Lao Kni is necessary; and if the
conclusions are favourable, the construction should not
be delayed.


There has been talk of establishing a tow path
along the river, and it certainly would be useful. But
if we are to go to any expense it is better to
incur the necessary sacrifice, so as to obtain a
complete and definite result. " Roads," Lord Dufferin
has said, " are a constant source of expense; a railway
ends by bringing in money."


The question of a railway to Lao Kai has come up
more than once. In March 1887 M. Chailley-Bert
announced definitely that the contracts were to be
put out for this line, which was to be completed in
two years, but so far, however, we have had to content
ourselves with words. Nothing, so far as I know,
has been done even in the way of a preliminary
survey of the country.


The taking over of Tonkin was only the first step
towards the penetration of China. The second must
now be taken, and this means the establishment of
a steamboat service and the construction of a railway
line. Let it not be said that one mode of transport
excludes the other, for look at Burmah, where a line
has been laid down parallel with the Irawaddy, and
<!-- Leaf 305, Page: 289 -->
we perspire but without feeling weakened; besides we
are descending the stream, and as the wind comes up
the valley it delays our advance, but it soon gives us a
little air. The river is 300 or 400 yards wide; the
banks are steep but low, the villages are numerous
and always surrounded by small woods, while sea gulls
wheel and cry over our heads. Our boats travel
slowly; the men have fastened the two pirogues
side by side, and like our boys they are busy
washing and dressing before they enter the city.
At four o'clock we pass the Laotian Custom House
on our left, and, thanks to our flag, we are not
stopped.


Here is Luang Prabang : at the first glance from
the boat we can see nothing, or at least very little
that indicates a city. For some hundreds of yards
there are Laotian buildings on the left bank of the
river, but their roofs are scarcely seen through vistas
amongst the palm trees, cocoa trees, and bamboos,
but the verdure gradually diminishes as the houses
become more crowded and are arranged in more
compact lines. AVe realise that it is an important city, au
earthen mound dominates the whole, surmounted by
one of those gilded domes, which recall the cupolas of
the Russian churches. In the confusion of yellowish
dwellings the pagodas are recognised by their superior
height and by their roofs which are covered with
brown tiles, laid one above the other and raised in
Chinese cornices at the extremities, the palace has
almost the air of an European building. Lower down,
lying against the river bank itself, immense rafts, real
houses of thirty to forty yards long, carry stocks of
merchandise and of various commodities, regularly

position to make the comparison. M. Massie,
moreover, has arrived at the same conclusion.


The trade of Laos, like that of the greater part of
Siam, is carried on by the Chinese, who form a sort
of freemasonry among one another against the
foreigner and are constantly pushing forward their
advance posts. Masters of the Customs, more
intelligent, more hard working, more temperate and
more rapacious than the Siamese, they constitute the
commercial class, and they have a wray of insinuating
themselves into the secrets of the natives and
transferring their money iuto their own pockets which we
neither could nor would wish to imitate. Our task is
a higher one, and it consists, upon the one hand, in
undertaking and carrying out such enterprises in the
way of mining as I have described above, and upon
the other in supplying the native or Chinese
middlemen with the raw material and with our national
goods upon as reasonable terms as English or German
merchandise.


It has been suggested that instead of transforming
our products to suit the Annamites and the Laotians,
we should get them to change their taste, but, even
if this false train of reasoning were true, that would
O 7
not solve the problem of how to extend our political
and commercial influence in the valley of the Mekong.
In order to do that, we should have to be first in the
field, and at less expense than our neighbours.


But what are they doing in the meanwhile 1 they
have commenced making a railway from Bangkok to
Korat and they are sending up the rivers gunboats
which are put together after they have reached their
destination. " Once the line is completed," as Mr.
<!-- Leaf 404, Page: 388 -->
means of communication being difficult, and the
people having no money.


After taking leave of our two acquaintances, we try
in vain to close our eyes, for we are quite helpless
before an invading cloud of mosquitoes.


Three days later, we reach, in the middle of the
night, Ayuthia, the ancient capital, still famous for its
monuments and its palace, the Versailles of the King
of Siam. Our Chinese boatmen have rowed seventeen
hours at a stretch, this amount of work being due to
the mode of payment adopted. During the entire
descent of the Menam I promise our men a premium
in inverse proportion to the time employed in
accomplishing the journey. This system stimulates them
and has good results.


In spite of the dangers that we were led to
fear from pirates, we have seen not the slightest trace
of them.


The canals of Ayuthia are encumbered by a flotilla
of small steamers, so without losing time we go from
i o o
one to another, waking the firemen, until we have
found one who will agree to take us at once to
Bangkok.


AVe are soon successful, and here we are at last on
our way, hurrying- clown by the light of a superb
moon. Stretched on the poop I see only the great
trees on either side, and I experience the delicious
sensation of being carried, quickly, tranquilly, and
alone, across a great forest. I remain for some time
awake, to follow the woods as they seem to run
behind us, and describe strange curves and spirals like
a ribbon which has got into a tangle.  
  
  
  I reflect that we are near Bangkok, namely, the end
<!-- Leaf 185, Page: 169 -->
of courage for the attempt, and without the complicity
of the inhabitants of the country it must certainly
have failed; unfortunately, the outpost had not
received any information, though for some weeks past the
unfortunate captain had complained of the difficulties
which he encountered in ascertaining the least
movement of the enemy. The nominal chief of the pirates
is an old doc (general), the Doc Keou, who is sixty
years of age; but the real chief is his lieutenant, the
Doc Ngu, formerly called dedoc in Annam; like his
fellow countrymen, he pretends that he is fighting
for the Emperor of Annam (Hamghi). Until now he
has always been victorious, and he is abundantly
supplied with arms and ammunition. The natives
fear and obey him, besides they have not much to
complain of, as he taxes them very little. His
strength, as we have said before, is partly due to us,
and his thorough acquaintance with several provinces
gives him great freedom of action.1 Let us hope that
the Government will at length realize its mistakes
and listen to the advice of those Avho for many years
have travelled in these districts. The evening of
the 15th is marked by a frightful tempest which lasts
all through the night, and shakes every building in
the post; luckily the houses are low and the wind has
little effect.  
  
  
  On the morning of the 16th we cross the river in  
  
  
  a ferry boat hollowed out of the trunk of a tree, in


1 A few months ago Doc Ngu's band was destroyed by Colonel
Pennequin, and the Doc Ngu himself has been beheaded by some
other Muong chiefs, who have thus rewarded us for having
granted them, thanks to the intervention of M. Vacle, autonomy
in their own territories.
<!-- Leaf 388, Page: 372 -->
the meaning of which is not clear to either the
Siamese lieutenant or the interpreter. There is also
a series of exclamations, which each one repeats twice,
these cries corresponding to our shouts of
encouragement : " Keep it up," " don't flinch," " steady," and
the like : Aou ! aou ! aoua! ioua ! pemma! sempa !
satna!


Sometimes the singing is in crescendo time and the
singer seems to be in a hurry. The company becomes
excited, encouraging and urging him on. A brass
bowl is continually passed round, flowing over with
tchoum-tchoum. The animation becomes greater and
greater and the party breaks up amid a general
hubbub.


Here are some scraps of the chanted dialogue which
I took down from the lips of the interpreter.


He.— 'I am very well off. I even have some
elephants."  
  
  
  She.—" I am not free."


He.—" If you marry me, you will have nothing to
do, and you will be free to act as you wish."  
  
  
  She. — " I am married. I have a child."


He.—"That doesn't matter. I'll arrange with
your husband so that he will let you go."


The chorus replies in a refrain too free to be
reproduced here.  
  
  
  She.—" You are married."


He.—"Ask the inhabitants of the village; I am
not married."


She.—" I have known for a long time that you
are poor. You haven't even a rupee."


He.—" I haven't a rupee, but we will go into
business and we shall have a good deal of money."
<!-- Leaf 142, Page: 126 -->
we have to do is to get our baggage on board. At
the very foot of the hill above Cho-Bo, the channel
of the stream narrows very much and the waters dash
tumultuously against the chaos of the gray rocks,
twisting round them and forcing a passage with all
the impetuosity of a torrent. These are rapids which
might, if necessary, be passed through by an ordinary
boat, but, as a rule, the boats, in order to avoid any
risk, are stopped either above or below according as
to whether they are descending or going up the river.
Those by which we are to travel are waiting for us
up stream, having been sent down to us from the
highlands by Deo Van Tri, a powerful landowner,
whose name will be constantly recurring. The
boatmen are from Caichau, tall, energetic men, with open
countenances, instinct with cheerfulness and
frankness, very much in contrast with the underhand
looks of nearly all the Annamites.


They fraternize with M. Vacle and empty a glass
of tchoum-tchoum with him, as he is an old
acquaintance of theirs, and while most of them are
ooing to row us up, two of them are to go on to
China and fetch priests for the ceremonies to be
performed in honour of the defunct father of Deo
Van Tri.


The Lai chief has, by a contract with the French
Protectorate, secured the transport service on the
Black River, with a fixed charge per man, per boat
or per weight. His interests are looked after at
Cho-Bo, by a Chinese representative, and it is by
him that our baggage is weighed, this operation being
performed by means of large Chinese scales hanging
from a transversal post held up by two men.
<!-- Leaf 229, Page: 213 -->
Tchas, Kas, whom we shall meet with elsewhere, belong
to the most miserable race of Indo-China. Their name
signifies servants or slaves; and, in fact, they are
always treated as such by the other tribes, perhaps
because they have been conquered with their brothers
the Penomhs, Steings, &c.; they are generally
regarded as autochthones, cousins of the black race of
Australia, the Negritos and the Papuans. Some of their
customs are curious. One of their tribes, dwelling
on the right bank of the Black River, makes, with fish,
all-spice, and other condiments, a very strong ferment,
which is placed in small bamboo tubes; the liquor is
drunk by sniffing with the nose. The specimens that
are now before us are very ugly and seem badly built;
one of them has a goitre. The legs, small with
disproportioned calves, often surrounded with bands of linen,
remind me of those of the djirinska men of Japan.
Some of them have straight green lines painted round
the mouth; and the lituong tells me that those who
are ornamented with these drawings belong to the
tribe of Tchasheus, which is also distinguished from
the others by some differences of dialect. Although
so miserable in appearance, these porters are excellent
walkers. The stage is quickly completed, but it is true
that it is not a very heavy one to-day. On leaving the
post at Lai, the road winds over the hdl,and then follows
the line of ridge between the Song-Bo and the Song-Na;
the country is wTell wooded, and near the top of a ficus
I notice a banana with its roots inserted in one of the
forks of the tree; it is a curious case. We descend
into the valley of the Song-Na, which we cross in a
pirogue, in order to sleep at Chinh Nua (pronounced
Tienne New). This village was the residence and the
<!-- Leaf 161, Page: 145 -->
sleep. Perhaps they make up for it when they are
at home.


Fires are not completely put out, for there are
plenty of fresh traces of tigers about. Nor is there
any lack of stags, but we can only hear them, without
getting a shot, as they are concealed in the tall reeds
which line the river banks. Young Thou says that
there are many more further on, and I am glad to let
this young Annamite rattle on, as he is a very curious
type, with his broad forehead, his straight nose, broad at
the base, his thick lips constantly being curled up, his
demure smile, and two fine rows of white teeth. He
has long narrow eyes, with scarcely any trace of
eyebrows and a head of black hair which he throws back
like a Robespierre. When he is speaking to the
boatmen, you might think that he was surprised at finding
himself opening his lips to such inferior persons, but
when he is talking to us or is in fear of being called
over the coals, you might take him for a martyr; with
all this, he is not in the least vicious, and though he has
little muscular strength, he is very inured to fatigue.
Vain as a man, proud of his race, industrious,
particular about his dress, fond of gambling, and honest, such
are the contradictory characteristics of this eccentric
personage, who would puzzle the most consummate
psychologist and who was brought into the world at
Hanoi by the wife of an Annamite tailor in the year
of grace 1866.


Despite his youth Thou has already travelled a good
deal, having been " boy " at Langson, and after that,
when in the service of Mr. Macey, he travelled through
the whole of upper Tonkin, the Sibsompanas, and
Laos. Luang Prabang dwells in his memory as a sort

the same small loose deep-blue vest, the same wide
trousers. The women wear the same full pleated
skirt which is so characteristic, and which I have
never seen anywhere else; the bodice, crossed in
front, fastened by a sash and worn with a large sailor
collar at the back, is also found in the mountains
which border on Yunnan-Fou. The men are
barelegged, but 011 special occasions the women wrap dark
blue bands round their legs; the chiefs, for full dress,
wear Turkish slippers, ordinary trousers, a small
apron of many colours, a narrow sash passed several
times round the waist, its fringed ends hanging down
on one side, and on the chest a square of embroidered
stuff, more striking and varied than those worn by
the Thais. This costume is very picturesque, the
predominant colours being white and deep blue. The
Meos use a very ingenious method for obtaining the
most varied designs without embroidery. For instance,
upon a white material they trace the desired pattern
in wax by means of a small copper instrument; thus
coated, the stuff is plunged into a bath of dye, and
when coloured it is placed in hot water, which
dissolves the wax and uncovers the tracing. Few
jewels are worn except ear-rings by thewromen, and by
the men a silver circlet round the neck to which
great value is attached. We cannot buy any of them,
for the people tell us that if they part from them
death will soon follow. They welcome us most
kindly, as they know the officers, and the
population is not distrustful, allowing us to visit
everything quite freely, and answering all our questions.


The interior of the huts is rather dirty; wroven mats
placed upon four posts serve for beds. In one corner

Laos cotton and European articles to Setcheou
carrying back tea and opium. It depends only upon
us to turn aside this current from a longer route and
to direct it upon Tonkin, feeding this region entirely
ourselves.


From Shanghai to Chung-King takes at present
thirty-five days, and it is clear in spite of the
difficulties put in the way by the Chinese Government,
and in spite of the natural obstacles which Hosie sees
in the swiftness of the current, rather than in the
shallowness of the stream, that Chung-King will one
day be reached by steamers. This admitted, let us
see what our commercial situation at Lao-Kai will be.


Let us conceive the great town of the Yangtze
and our Tonkin depot as being the two eastern
extremities of a rectangle drawn upon the map and
embracing Yunnam, half of Setchuen and a portion
of Thibet; and take two articles of the same
sort and the same intrinsic value; the one having
arrived at Lao-Kai, the other at Chung-King. The
* o o
former has been carried for two days instead of
sixteen on a steamer,1 and will have paid fourteen
times less freight than the second; consequently in
being sent from Lao-Kai northward, or
north-westward, or westward, it will have a start of fourteen to
one over the object sent from Chung-King to the
south or south-west.


In making this supposition, I have moreover, not
taken into account three advantages which our position
at Tonkin gives us, but which are not to be
overlooked.  
  
  
  1. Obviously, the cost of freight should be less

which contained some of the spirit known as
tchounitchoum, purchased in the morning at Takoa. We
think it best to shut our eyes to all this, for it is
desirable to be indulgent, upon occasions, to those
who serve you well. This evening, by way of
celebrating the feast, everything is in common, and even
the boys condescend to share in the rejoicings.


As a rule the men dine in several detachments, one
of them acting as cook for the others, those who are of
the same family or from the same village clubbing
together. As I watch them eat, drink, and make merry,
I am tempted to wonder whether they have not
discovered the secret of true happiness—very few objects
of anxiety, few creeds, few desires, few wants, and
little to gain or little to lose. They will leave the
world as they came into it, content with what they
have, living from hand to mouth, without looking
beyond. It may be that their philosophy is inherent
in their race and is the work of destiny; and we may
well ask whether it is in the name of humanity that
we thrust ourselves between them and their happiness,
introducing among them the traces of a factitious
civilisation, which shows them the steps that have
to be climbed, but as a rule without givino- them
the means of ascending.


While our boatmen are preparing their feast, we
take advantage of the stop to do a bit of shootino-.
It is bad walking over the hfllsides, rendered slippery
by the bamboo leaves with which they are covered,
and if one tries to save a fall, one is as likely as not
to plant one's foot upon a prickly shrub or a nest of
red ants. This is not very agreeable, and to make
matters worse, the red monkeys wdiich we try to shoot,

body is constantly shifting. Moreover, women dressed
in white, generally old maids or widows, also have
their heads shaved and become female priests, their
special duty being to make the collections at the
pagodas.


The signal for the commencement of the principal
acts of worship is a big bell placed upon the summit
of the hill, and it is also used as an alarm bell in the
event of fire, in which case it is rung in quite a
different way.


The bonzes give instruction to their pupils, preside
over certain festivals and preach to the people : they
read passages from the sacred books, inculcate charity,
and above all impress upon their congregations the
importance of making many presents to the pagoda
so as to be well pleasing to heaven and to deserve
everlasting life.


In a small chapel, in front of each pagoda, a bronze
bell rings every afternoon at four o'clock, while on
Sundays and fete days it rings at 1 a.m. The bonzes,
be it added, are supposed to make only two meals a
day, in the early morning and at noon, but their
pupils are not expected to conform to this rule.


From the second grade the priest is supposed to
be a celibate, but the rule is sometimes disregarded,
and it is no uncommon thing for a priest of loose
habits to change his dres at dusk and go out to amuse
himself. If his superiors catch him, he and his
accomplice are sentenced to some such severe labour
as supplying bricks for the pagoda, while in Cambodia
they are more severe, the pagoda itself being closed.


These vows are not necessarily perpetual, and if a
Tiammone feels that he no longer has any vocation,

who counsel delay to cast their eyes across the Mekong
and see how busy the English and the Germans are
making the line to Korat. Perhaps they would then
admit that we have no time to lose unless we wish to
illustrate for the benefit of our neighbours in Asia the
fable of the hare and the tortoise.

use his eyes aright. There is much to be seen in the
way of curiosities, for it is hardly appropriate to give
the name of " monument," which implies
somethingartistic, to the grotesque Chinese sanctuaries. "
Temple of the 500 Genii " is the name given to a pagoda
filled with gilded Buddhas, which are placed in rows
against the walls like the shrivelled monks in the
Capucin monastery at Palermo. Before each idol
rises a thin column of blue smoke emanating from a
small stick of perfume, and the guide points out in
the midst of all these genii a statue gilded like the
others but surmounted by a pilgrim's black hat. This is
the famous Marco Polo, and the artist who is
responsible for this work of art has made a point of giving
him a pair of round eyes by way of distinguishing
him from the people of his own country.


Then, again, the Temple of the Horrors is a rough
delineation of the tortures of hell. But that I do not
wish to be wanting in respect for art in the celestial
empire, I should be inclined to say that these
sculptures are a bad imitation of the scenes of the
Inquisition as they are depicted at the booths of French
fairs.


There still remained to be seen a water-clock which
has been going for six centuries, the place for
executions, a potter's field where there are a large number
of big jars into which the heads of the decapitated
criminals roll, and many more pagodas; but the rate
of locomotion in the narrow streets is so slow that it
is already dusk, and we are compelled to hurry back
before the gates of the town are closed.


But our excursion is not yet over, for outside the
walls there is the floating town to be visited, and this
<!-- Leaf 5 -->
  
  AROUND TONKIN AND SIAM
<!-- Leaf 153, Page: 137 -->
caused by some great geological disturbance, or by a
fissure possibly brought about in the calcareous mass
by the weight of water from the mountains. The
formation does not seem to have been gradual but rather
the result of some violent phenomenon. The cliffs
appear at this point as if they, had been abruptly torn
asunder, for they correspond to each other; the
projections upon one side fit in as it were to the
hollow of the other, so much so that one might fancy
that the work was that of man.


While I am making these reflections we have
crossed the limit which divides the two provinces, and
at the same time the dangerous passage where the
boats are exposed to an attack from the pirates from
above. All that we now have to do is to be on our
guard against the dangers of the stream, for the rapids
are so numerous that I cannot mention them all, there
often being as many as twenty in the course ofthe day.
They are however not so dangerous in going up the river
as in coming down, when the least error in
steeringwould send the boat on to the rocks with the force of
the current. They are always to be dreaded, though less
so at this season than in the summer, when the sudden
flushes are terrific; the river being inaccessible for
several days at a time, there is little hope then for
those that have been unable to find shelter, and whole
convoys of more than fifteen canoes have been carried
off and have disappeared in a single night. As a rule
nearly all those that have navigated in these waters
have come to grief at least once, as the members of
the Pavie Mission know to their cost. M. Vacle went
down the stream a good deal faster than he wanted
to go, holding on to the roof of the canoe, which
<!-- Leaf 342, Page: 326 -->
and among the component parts of it are young girls
bare to the waist, with a smile upon their lips, their
arms encircled by several gold bracelets, and with a
gardenia in their hair, Avhile beside them, perchance
looking much more frail and humble, is a Ka woman
with a turban upon her head and a basket on her
back, fastened by a piece of leather going round her
forehead. Then there are groups of Kas, ten or
twelve together, who walk about with a timid, startled
look, and try to dodge my photographic apparatus.
Following these, perhaps, is a convoy of prisoners,
wearing black gaiters to avoid the friction of the rings
in their chains, behind them being the Siamese
soldiers, who have silk trousers, linen vest and felt
hat. Their aspect and bearing denote the parvenu,
and they display all the insolence of new masters,
contrasting with the calm, dignified air of the portly
bonzes, who, robed in yellow and escorted by their
young pupils, proceed with measured and self-satisfied
tread.


There is little sign of hurry in the crowd, and it is
as much as they can do to move out of the way to let
a royal elephant or the vehicle which is conveying a
Minister to the Royal Council Chamber go by.


The shops and booths contain the various products
of the country, such as articles of food, strong
condiments, rice cakes, jam, and all that is required
to make the quids of betel-nut, barks of red wood,
native shirts, scarves, flowers for the pagodas,
earthenware pans, iron implements, small pigs of
lead (from Ban Lathane, one or two clays' sail up the
Mekong), and a variety of other local goods. In
addition to these, there are the articles imported either

Here, too, as in Ceylon, coffee should occupy an
important place. Ten years ago, out of the 60,000
tons of coffee grown, Brazil produced half, and the
AVest Indies a sixth. A learned botanist and observer,
{empty}M. Balansa, has stated that from a climatic point of
view Annam and Tonkin approach the most nearly
t<> Brazil, so that we ought to take a very prominent
position in the coffee markets of the world. The
Siberian plants seem to be the most liked and the
hardiest, while there is less to fear now from the
Hemileia vastatrix. The coffee plant ought to do
well in the highlands, and experiments have already
been made upon a very small scale, some of the plants
distributed to the chiefs growing strong and healthy,
as I have seen with my own eyes. A cultivation of
more than 10,000 coffee plants has been entered upon
at Kecheu, not far from Hanoi, and so far it has
answered very well.


This is a convenient opportunity for saying a few
words about the Frenchmen who have commenced
the experiments—two of them, the brothers Guillaume,
plain peasants by birth, very energetic and
hardworking, after completing their period of military
service in Tonkin, settled in the country, their first
venture being the working of a marble quarry, in
connection with which they learned to draw and copy
models.


With the profits derived from this they purchased
some ewes, and made with their milk the cheese
which is so much appreciated in Tonkin, and they
are now owners of extensive phtntations. While one
of them is at Hanoi, the other remains to superintend
the works. The fact that thev do not haunt the
<!-- Leaf 99, Page: 83 -->
necessity of taking steps for driving Doc-Ngu into a
corner. It was only the other day, again, that
another territory was dislocated, the motive for this
proceeding being one to which I shall refer later on.


The effective of our troops is too small. We
disturb the enemy without crushing him, and when
we have got him into a critical position, we give up
pursuit and let him have time to recuperate, while
our efforts tend in another direction. This mode of
proceeding neutralizes the best possible results. The
public probably has no idea of the number of
European troops in Tonkin on paper. There are
8,000, but we could not put in the field more than
3,000, all the accessory services being discharged by
regular soldiers. These figures are supplied me by
field officers, who are urgent in their demand for
reinforcements, while by a singular phenomenon, in
proportion as the army demands au increase of its
contingents, the civil authority insists upon a
reduction. The course of events supplies the sole answer
as to which of the two demands is justified.


So far as the sea was concerned, a vigorous course
of action seemed to have stopped piracy, and, with
forts established at various points, we were justified
in assuming that tranquillity would prevail along the
coast. But, strange to say, these forts were
withdrawal without the admiral having been consulted;
the Indo-Chinese naval division was suppressed, and
the credit opened for the repair of the gunboats was
allotted to another branch of expenditure, all
this simultaneous with the permission given the
native junks to carry rapid-firing guns and rifles.
But I will not pursue the matter further, as those

the Government imposes for the concessions granted.
These conditions, as laid down in the official decree of
February, 1888, are as under :—


{empty}1. Deposit of a franc per hectare (about 4d. per
acre) of land conceded, the concession being for five

years;

{empty}2. Undertaking to cultivate the land within five

years;

{empty}3. Payment of taxes upon the portions cultivated

after the third year;


{empty}4. Renewal of the concession by periods of thirty
years, if at the expiration of the fifth year the above
conditions have been complied with; withdrawal, in
the contrary event, of the portions not put into
cultivation.


But M. Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, studying- the history
of the colonization of Australia and America, points
out that the regime of full ownership and liberty is
preferable to these concessions, and shows how in
Algeria lands which people refused to take as
concessions in 1888 have, when put up to public sale,
fetched high prices.


Notwithstanding the mistakes which have been
made, we still have countless agricultural resources
to avail ourselves of, and, to show what the Dutch
have done in conditions scarcely more favourable,
let me quote the following extract from a planter
who, after having spent several years in Sumatra,
has been visiting Tonkin :—


\"The most striking instance of the extent to which
a colony well provided with capital can develop is
Sumatra, where I have worked for many years.  
  
  
  "In 1866, a Dutchman, Heer Niewenhuis, settled

the expenditure of a big sum all at once, and the
deplorable results of this system of false economy are
to be seen in every direction. It is through this
that the barracks of Phalang-Tuong and of the Seven
Pagodas, which cost 180,000 piastres, already require
rebuilding. A post had been constructed at Yen-Lan,
and shortly afterwards it was decided to erect another,
at about an hour's inarch from there, at Dong-Trieu.
This latter was built at a cost of 15,000 piastres, but
when it came to putting on the roof the funds, it was
found, were exhausted. What did those in authority
do but take the tiles off the roof of the post-house at
Yen-Lan and put them on the other! The
consequence was that the former is falling into ruins and
will have to be rebuilt. I could quote many other
cases of the same kind.


There is a fixed resolve, moreover, to turn every
transaction to financial account, no matter how
vexatious may be the methods resorted to. Any one who
is about to negotiate an affair with the administration
has to lodge a sum of money as deposit, and in the
beginning interest was allowed at the rate of 3 per
cent., and this in a country were money was worth
10 or 12. But now the money is lodged in a local
deposit bank, which not only gives no interest, but
takes three or four months to cash a treasury order.
The financial difficulties of the Government may be
held to extenuate this procedure, but there is no
excuse for certain illicit doings, of which I will quote
only one instance :—


The Chinaman who had the monopoly for the vehicles
known as pousse-pousse at Hanoi, had paid 5,000
piastres as caution money. Under the pretence of

few months ago. His head is shaven and he wears a
white turban, which he frequently removes during his
visit; he has a gray tunic or ma kouazeu, and wide
white trousers; his feet and ankles are wrapped in
linen bands, with gray slippers worn over them.


The conversation is easy, he does not speak French,
but he frequently understands it, sometimes even
sooner than the interpreter. In any case, no one
has better opportunities for learning languages, for
in his own district thirty-two idioms are spoken,
and he knows most of them. Chinese, Thais, Meo and
Annamite are equally familiar to him. Deo Van Tri
is certainly an extraordinary personage. His name,
although familiar to all those wdio have been in
Tonkin, is probably unknown to the majority of my
readers; it therefore necessary, after introducing
the man, to give them some information about his
origin, his history, and his present position.


Deo Van Tri, in Chinese Deo Van Ki, the son of
Deo Van Sen,1 is called Vuei-Sin by his equals in China,
His name is Cam Hourn in Thai, and he has seven
brothers whose names all commence with Cam.2 He
tells us that his forefathers wrere natives of Canton.
AVhen the Mings fell, two centuries ago, his ancestor, a
Chinese general in the service of the fallen race, came
to Tonkin with a group of partisans. They, at first,
settled at Bac-Ninh, but afterwards his family was


1 Deo is the Chinese and Annamite surname which belongs to
all the brothers, sons, nephews, &c, of Deo Van Tri. Van is a
particle which serves to unite the name to the personal name.
Ki or Tri, Sen or Seng, &c, are the personal names.


2 Cam is a Thai title belonging to the feudal nobility,
something like lord—Cam Hourn, Lord Hourn; Cam Kouy, Lord
Kouy.

Is the commerce here worth the trouble already
spent upon it ? Are fresh efforts justifiable f  
  
  
  This is what I propose to examine.


To begin with, the Black River must be struck out
as impracticable for trade purposes. It is too sinuous,
and above Tuen-Quan the rapids render navigation
impossible to every sort of vessel except small
canoes.


In the west, the Black River cannot be compared
to the Red River, rapids abounding in the former, and
navigation in the upper waters being often dangerous.
Steamboats at present go up only as far as Cho-Bo,
and, as I have already said, the small sloop Le
Leygnes, which the Pavie Mission was able to utilize
higher up, was w-recked at Takoa. I went up the
Song-Bo and came down the Song-Coi. The
one is to the other what a torrent is to a
river. The difference of the two water-courses is
easily enough defined by mentioning the sort of
boats they carry. On the upper Black River only
such canoes as we have seen, namely, forty
feet long, and carrying at the most three tons,
can be used. On the Red River, junks eighty feet
long, and carrying nine tons are employed.


Although the Black River issues from a region at
present richer and more populous than that washed
by the upper Red River, I do not see in the traffic,
as now developing, any immediate likelihood of
compensation sufficient to make up for the considerable
cost of undertaking the works necessary for steam
navio-ation on the Song-Bo. The most that can be
clone is to blow up a few rocks to permit the passage
of canoes, which boats will increase in number, there
<!-- Leaf 204, Page: 188 -->

Several of the smaller chiefs accompany us,
amongst others the son of our host at Maison.
Colonel Pennequin took him to Hanoi two years ago,
and he therefore thinks that he ought to make some
concessions to European fashions, so he wears red
leather buskins, has a gold watch, and carries a
silverheaded cane in one hand. His face is energetic, he
understands some words of French, and our presents
of chromolithographs and Parisian stuffs meet with
his approval; one portion of them is to be remitted
to his father.


Nothing fresh has happened at Van Bou. The
colonel has gone back to Hanoi; no one has heard of
any fresh attacks from the pirates. Some pirogues
have arrived from Laichau so we can start again, and
intend doing so after stopping one clay.


In leaving Van Bou, I cannot sufficiently express
my thanks to Colonel Pennequin, the officers and
noncommissioned officers, for their hearty welcome, for
the information which they have given us, and for
the facilities which they provided for our excursions
and for the remainder of our voyage. On the eve
of our departure the non-commissioned officers invited
us to take wine with them and we joyously drank
to each other's success, and above all to France ! I
was struck by the good humour, the gaiety, and the
cordiality which reigned, and, at the same time, when
it became a question of going into active service,
with what enthusiasm each one claimed the honour
of going, and what honour ! Not always the chance
of promotion or of winning a decoration, but of
exposing one's self to a ball fired from behind, under
shelter of a bush, the risk of illness and fever, of
<!-- Leaf 23, Page: 7 -->
named, we meet several compatriots, who are as
cordial in their hospitality as the majority of those
one meets abroad. They nearly all represent large
Lyons firms, silk being the principal object of trade
at Canton, which, we are told, exports it to the value
of £96,000,000 a year. Half of this goes to France.
German middlemen are said to make at least £400,000
a year in commission out of the silk trade, for, apart
from the French in the colony, there are many German
and English houses that supply the Lyons looms.


The purchase of silk requires considerable practice
when one has to do with vendors like the Chinese.
Each skein has to be unwound and the thickness of
the thread calculated by weight in order to see if it is
uniform throughout, for there is no sort of deception
which is not practised, a very frequent one being to
mix together different crops. Very keen in trade, the
people of Cauton, despite the dealings which they have
with them, do not like " the foreign devils," who are
obliged to keep a supply of arms in their houses, several
of which will, no doubt, be set fire to again in due
course, as they were in 1884, when the European
Consuls were content with exacting a ludicrously
insufficient compensation. At the present time, the hatred
which we inspire does not stand in the way of our
entering the native part of the town, and in a day one
sees, and, let me add, smells quite enough of it. The
reader must not be surprised if I refer here to the smell,
for in my opinion it is a much more important factor
in travel than is generally supposed. I believe, in effect,
that, like different animals, each human race has its
own characteristic smell, derived from itself, its
perfumes, its food, its animals, and its plants forming a
<!-- Leaf 227, Page: 211 -->
lack anything in the other world, for the objects which
he used in his lifetime are carefully arranged in the
interior of the hut—his clothes, his pipe, a supply of
opium, and a small pirogue. Thou tells me that a
great deal of gold has been placed in the tomb, and
in his materialism our boy thinks that the money
would be far better in his own pocket; he would
have more to lose at gambling. AVhen we arrived
in the evening at moonrise, we heard plaintive cries
and strange bowlings proceeding from the funeral
inclosure. The Thao cut them short by
imprisoning the mourner, one of his sisters, who is a widow
and in great despair, because, through the
strictness of the rite, she is forced to wait three years
before she can marry again.


The reader will see that while staying at Laichau
we do not lack subjects for observation and notes, or
for interesting studies. But we cannot stay long either
here or anywhere else, so we must occupy ourselves
with the means of continuing our journey. I explain
to Deo A^an Tri my favourite scheme of ascending the
Black River, forming a caravan to go to Xienhoung,
and from there trying to get into Burmah, Bhamo,
or Mandalay. The first part of the journey is very
feasible; the members of the Pavie Mission have
travelled along the route that passes by Poufang; but
it is very bad and requires a great deal more time
than I supposed; at least thirty or forty days.
Another and better road leads through the Yunnan,
but it is twice as long.


There have been some disturbances at Xienhoung;
and the Queen has just been dethroned.
Nevertheless, Deo Van Tri assures me, that with a letter from

cotton, porcelains, needles, gray or red silks, &c,
and receive in exchange those Thibetan stuffs which,
when coarse, are known in Chinese as Montse, in
Thibetan as Laoua, and when fine are called poulou
by the Chinese and tchro by the people of Thibet;
woollen belts, plants for dying borax, rock bees-wax,
hides, musk, felt, gold1 (worth sixteen, eighteen or
nineteen times its weight in silver), rhubarb, the fine
horseshoe rhubarb, fetching on the spot only a few
centimes the pound.


For my own part I believe that a great future is in
store for the valley of the Upper Mekong above Tali.
It is rich in remunerative products, and the climate is
good. The missionaries in their experiments more to
the west at Bonga have proved that all European
products thrive there. As this natural wealth increases
it must fellow the main currents, eastward by the
Yangtze and to the south-east through Tonkin.

O ~
Finally in western Yunnam we may substitute our
products, silks for instance, for those which the
caravans come three times a year to fetch in
YunnamSen and take down to Burmah by way of
IongTchang-Fou or Ten-Ne-Tcheou.

the same throughout Western Setchuen. In one district that I
traversed, a nugget of fifty-four pounds was found. In one
year 1,500 Chinese pounds of gold were extracted.

It would be too long and too difficult for one so
little acquainted with the technicality of the work to
enter into any detail of what is being done, but I may
mention that three seams have been put into working
order, and that they have received the names of
Bavier, Chater, and Marmottan. They are, upon the
average, 23 feet deep and at an angle of 80 degrees.
The galleries, with beams to prop them up, are about
7 feet high by 10 feet broad, with ventilating shafts
at intervals of 130 feet, The Chater gallery has been
driven to a distance of, five furlongs in eighteen
O O
months, the rate of progress being from 90 to 93 feet
a month. The calculations based upon the parallelism
ofthe strata give a depth of at least 816 feet. The
working of the galleries is conducted in such a way
as to prevent the fissures from being complete and to
avoid the dangers of fire breaking- out. There has
not, so far, been any fire-damp, whereas at Kebao
there has been some. There is, moreover, very little
water, and even in the galleries, which are nearly
50 feet below the level of the sea, a steam pump
suffices to get rid of it all in two hours.


The beams used for propping up the galleries cost
about a penny for three feet, and the works are
supervised by a French engineer, who lives close to
the mine and sends in a daily report to M. Durrant,
coming in to Hong-Hay every Saturday evening and
spending Sunday with him.  
  
  
  The engineers are left to choose their ownworkmen, and they prefer the Annamites, who, they say,
are more tractable and easier to manage than
tinChinese, The Annamite is paid a franc a day, from
which sum is deducted the price of his rice, but as he
<!-- Leaf 304, Page: 288 -->
with his hands on his hips, is on horseback upon
a pedestal, he also has tusks, round eyes and
extraordinarily large ears; and on the ground, in the midst
of fragments of innumerable prayers written in Laotian
upon palm leaves, lie innumerable statues, some of
them wearing chasubles; a few gods are riding upon
elephants; while chariots are also represented by
small wooden vehicles placed upon four wheels,
and ornamented with pieces that overhang them like
rostra, A series of small divinities are carved, each
iii separate medallions, upon painted panels of wood
fastened in pairs; but it is quite impossible to describe
everything, for taking into consideration the means at
the makers' disposal, and the more or less æsthetic
feelino- which animates them, I think that one would
find here everything that a people's imagination could
devise to materialise its superstitions, to give bodily
form to its beliefs, or to manifest its piety. And I
cannot help thinking of certain grottos in Europe; of
the statues, the ex-votos, the inscriptions and banners,
the ogives which ornament them, and the crowds that
flock to them. Pakou is also a shrine for pilgrimages;
the people come from Luang Prabang with great pomp
several times a year; they hold boat races, get up
picnics, and pray. The grotto has another
advantage for us besides its religious interest, for it gives us a
fine view over the valley of the Mekong; but it is the
middle of the day, and the light is so intense that
the distance is lost in a trembling atmosphere of
heat. AVhen we return to the pirogues, I find it is
more than 125 degrees in the sun, and my alcohol
thermometer has burst.  
  
  
  In spite of the temperature we do not suffer much, for

can open in a smile which he means to be amiable,

Intelligence, tenacity and suppleness, such are the
chief characteristics of Kinh-Luoc, representative in
Tonquin of H.M. the Emperor of Annam. He is an

hung upon a silk thread.


A hundred yards or so beyond the principal cafe,
on the right side of the street, opens a large square,
very bright, with plenty of flowers and shady trees,
having a large building upon each side which is
reserved for the higher officials. This is the Place du
Gouvernement, in the centre of which is a kiosk
where a military band plays on Thursday and
Sunday. Here, too, is a bronze statue representing Paul
Bert leaning upon an Annamite, and contemplating
the lake which lies at his feet, and the £160 which
this monument cost was nearly made up of small
subscriptions collected in Indo-China. The islet with
its small pagoda, the primitive wooden bridge thrown
across it, the Place du Gouvernement with its
buildings upon one side, the low houses, with their
leaning roofs, of the native town beyond, and upon
the other side the foliage amid which the bank of
IndoChina is hidden and above which rise the towers of
Monseigneur Pugenier's Cathedral, all contribute to
make of Hanoi one of the brightest, prettiest and most
picturesque cities of the far East, while the road which
runs round it forms a promenade much appreciated by

our descent of the Mekong. He seems very grateful
to M. Pavie, who once saved his life, and he makes
even more favourable an impression upon us than his
son, though both seem well disposed towards the
Europeans—if they were free to act. But Siam plays
the same part towards them that China does to
Thibet, and one would hope that the era of liberty is
at hand which, in delivering the two countries from
the yoke which oppresses them, will open a valuable
field of study to our science and fresh outlets to our
commerce.


Between the palace and the river bank a broad
street runs parallel to the market, and at frequent
intervals are jars containing water, placed there by
the inhabitants, who believe that in so doing they are

making sure of a reward hereafter.


There are several artisans in this quarter, and we
were taken to see a goldsmith, the bellows of whose
forge consisted of the trunk of a hollow tree with
a piston inside, and he tells us that he had left the
king's service because he was so irregularly paid.
There are several other pagodas at the far end of
the town to be visited, including that of Ouate Sieng
Tong, in which we notice a large banner on which
are depicted a series of circles representing the
march of Buddha. True believers can see upon these
banners the footprints of the god, and these figures
reproduced upon the coats of the soldiers are regarded
as a talisman.


Among the accessory monuments in the courtyard
is a small pyramid partly covered with blades of
silver or copper and bearing a Laotian inscription,
which, as the interpreter tells me, informs passers-by
<!-- Leaf 221, Page: 205 -->
sent to the Black River by a king of Annam, of the
dynasty of Les, to wage wTar against piracy. For
thirteen generations the Deos have resided in Laichau
or its neighbourhood.


The history of Deo Van Seng and his sons is very
confused, and its repetition here would be difficult and
not very interesting. I have read a chronicle, dictated
by the chief of Lai to a Cambodian interpreter, which
relates the perpetual wars which for the last
twentyyears have devastated the country between Lai and
Luang Prabang. Deo Van Seng, named by the King of
Annam Quan sou de Theng, and chief of the
sibsougchou-Thais (the twelve Thais provinces), aided by his
sons, Quan chau de Muong Lai (this is Deo Van Tri),
and Quang chau of Muong Kanai, fought for the Court
of Hue, sometimes against the Chinese Hos, sometimes
against the Siamese. Acting upon instructions sent
by the King of Annam to the mandarin of Muong
Luang (Luang Prabang), the latter made peace with
the Deo family. But the Siamese are perfidious;
they inveigled Deo Van Tri's brothers into an ambush,
made them all prisoners and sent them to Bangkok.
This crime could not remain unpunished. At the head
of 300 men Deo Van Tri descended to Luang Prabang
\"to confer with the mandarin on neighbourly terms; "
but his men could not agree with the Laotiens. A
discussion arose between them which degenerated
into a quarrel, they came to blows, and the city was
burnt and sacked. These events took place in 1887.
{empty}M. Pavie, who was then at Luang Prabang, alone
with four or five servants, saved the King and held a
conference with the chief of Lai, who then retired.  
  
  
  To render this account intelligible, we have been
<!-- Leaf 308, Page: 292 -->
to both at once, these Laos States have often been as
reasonably considered Burmese as Annamite, or later
on, as Siamese. At war with Annam now and again,
the Laotians of this region conquered Ton quin eight
centuries ago, but it is, none the less, with tbe Court
of Hue that Luang Prabang preserves the closest ties.
The chronicles of the town, which have been very
conscientiously kept and which were saved from the
flames by M. Pavie, testify in many passages to this
state of dependency; and among these annals may be
found the narrative of an invasion of Annamite troops
in the seventeenth century which led to the suicide of
the sovereign of Luang Prabang.1 At a more recent
date eye-witnesses have related the expedition of Deo
Aran Tri referred to in a previous chapter, the Lai
chief assuming his right to treat w-ith the king upon
behalf of the Emperor of Annam.


Without seeking to undertake an historical work,
which would carry us too far, we have only to glance
over some of the old maps to find the justification for
that phrase of Gamier's which should have been the
groundwork of our policy in this region. " AVhat we
had to do was to make the king of Luang Prabang
feel that a day might come when we should take up
the rights exercised over his principality by the Court
of Hue, which has now become once more our vassal.1
Unfortunately, the Siamese, w-hose influence had
extended, after 1838 2 towards Luang Prabang, came and


1 The legend has it that the king, when on the point of being
made prisoner, had himself attached to the trunk of an elephant
and the animal taken down into the river. A pagoda was
erected in memory of the drowned ruler.


- According to Hallett (A Thousand Miles on an Elephant,
{empty}p. 201), the Shan States of Vienchang and of Luang Prabang

economy would also arise. But this would carry
us too far, bringing into conflict the partisans of the
civil and the military systems, those who favour a
protectorate and those who advocate conquest
outright, each theory lending itself to valid arguments.


Our original error consisted in believing first that
one system was good and then the other, the two
being, perhaps, diametrically opposed. The
consequence is that there has been a lack of unity
and cohesion in our ideas, and we have undone
one day what had been done the day before.
The colony has suffered from this vacillation, and
while the mischief we have done has been of
advantage to our enemies, the good we have done has been
of little profit to ourselves, as it has been a mere
isolated incident, and has not grafted itself on to
anything which had occurred before.


Tonkin was taken by force of arms, and then came
the Philastre mission, the deplorable results of which
need not be referred to here; after this, there was a
succession of generals, who applied the system of
conquest in the most rigorous way possible. Finding
that this had been carried too far, the civil regime
was all at once substituted for the military, and the
latter force was at a loss what attitude to assume.
The instructions which it had received were, as we
learnt from M. Constans in 1888. directly opposite to
those of the Govern or-General. In order to check
what was regarded as the excessive zeal of the
military element, the outposts were forbidden to
make any kind of sortie without permission of the
civil government, while the natives were enjoined
not to give them any direct information whatever.  
  
  
  G
<!-- Leaf 277, Page: 261 -->
Even in crossing the road I remark some differences
between the inhabitants and the Thais whom we
have just left. Here the men shave the head, leaving
only a small circle of short hair on the top. The
women wear only one garment, which is fastened
round the waist. At first sight the type seems to
me distinct from that of Thai; I think it is rather
more European, there is a look of Indo-Caucasian
relationship. The face is paler and longer, the
cheekbones less prominent, the eyes less oblique than
those of their Eastern brothers. However, I am only
stating a first impression, which requires
confirmation. AVe are entering Laos itself, and shall soon
be in a position to verify our observations. Nothing
detains us here, our coolies are paid and dismissed,
and we have but to start. AVe find four pirogues
sufficient for our party; they are about ten yards long,
but narrower than those on the Black River; the
awnings are higher, and bamboos tied to both sides
of the boats make them balance more steadily. The
boatmen use two kinds of oars, which they manage
sometimes with the aid of a bamboo ring as a kind
of rowlock, sometimes with both hands only. One
oar is small and made in a single piece, the other is
larger, and has a wooden blade fastened to it by
small stems of bamboo. The sail of a windmill gives
a very fair idea of it. A steersman uses a similar oar
in the front of the boat, to guide the pirogue through
the rapids.


The boatmen wear a sampot, a kind of petticoat
folded between the legs so that it forms puffed
breeches; one of them has his legs tattooed up to the
knees; the designs, half circles surrounding dragons,
<!-- Leaf 231, Page: 215 -->
in the same way as in France by massing earth round
the roots, but here two or three plants are placed
together. The soil is rich, and some of the stalks are
nine feet high. Charles, who comes from the Franche
Comte declares that he has never seen anything so
fine in his home. Some tombs are raised at different
places on the hills, they are built in Chinese fashion,
and always display a small terrace resting upon an
earthen wall shaped like a horse-shoe.


The Meos whom we meet seem vigorous; they all
wear a silver collar like those seen above Van Bou.
We are told that the Chinese characters engraven upon
the band of silver that forms it represent prayers and
invocations against the evil spirits, and not as some
writers have said the owner's name. The Chinese
trade upon the simplicity of the mountaineers, and,
persuading them that these inscriptions will secure a
long life for them, charge very highly for the necklets
in kind, at the rate of several sacks of rice. Already
a few natives are wearing the costumes of Yunnan—
the pointed straw hat, small white drawers, bands on
the lower part of the legs, and sandals held in place by
a strap passed between the great and second toes.


High trenches are placed at intervals by the side of
the road to enable the porters to rest themselves by
leaning their burdens upon them, and at the turnings,
posts split at the top in the form of stars defend the
passers-by from the influence of evil genii.


While following our road from basin to basin, and
from plain to plain, we allow ourselves to be overtaken
by the darkness. Fortunately the moon rises, and
her light shows us two or three low houses, with a
shed in front, and, fastened to its posts, about a dozen

gain information on so important a subject except
after long searches in libraries," and often fruitless.
o J


I may ask, with M. Wehrung, "Why the
department of Foreign Affairs has not given publicity to
some passages in the very complete reports of M.
Rocher 1" which, if I may judge by a copy sent me as
a personal favour by a friend in Tonkin, are very
interesting.


I should like to give them in full, as much because
of the opinions expressed as owing to the authority
of their author, who is so well-known by his writings
and his long experience of affairs in the Far East.


\"The Setchuen, Kouitchou and Canton route," he
says, "although much longer, will continue to furnish
their contingent of merchandise, and that will be the
case as long as the Red River route, the advantage of
which no one questions, is looked upon with so much
doubt, and so long as the scarcity of junks, both at
Hanoi and Manghao, keeps the price at such a pitch
as to be remunerative for the junk owners and
outfitters, but ruinous for trade."


The penury of junks arises from the obstacles to
navigation in the' Red River. The timber suitable
for a junk capable of overcoming the obstacles in the
river have to be obtained from distant unhealthy
virgin forests, the very aspect of w-hich is enough
to frighten the workman. AVhile, on the banks of
the Yangtze, the boatman always find a living by
its trade, population, and ready to encourage
commerce and navigation. Along the Song-Coi, on the
contrary, there is still considerable risk from pirates.
<!-- Leaf 317, Page: 301 -->
for the treasury of Luang Prabang is the produce of
the customs, there being a tax of three per cent, upon
the merchandise and of a basket of salt upon each
canoe which comes up from the south with a load of it.


The Laos army is kept up at a very slight cost, there
being only, apart from the Siam troops, a royal corps,
dressed in European style and armed with
rapid-firingrifles. The rest of the men are supplied in the event
of war, by the villages with their own form of weapon,
and they are not likely to be dangerous opponents
for a long time to come, as shown by the wray in which
they fled before the soldiers of Deo Aran Tri.


The territory is not extensive; and although the
frontiers are in many places not at all clearly defined,
they may be stated approximately as follows : to
the east the State of Luang Prabang begins, when
descending the Nam-Ou, three or four days before the
confluence of that stream with the Mekong, while it
is a three clays' journey clown the latter southward to
the frontier and twice as far northward before
reaching the confines of Xieng Mai. To the westward,
the frontier is not so far, being more or less nearly
formed by the watershed of the Mekong and of the
Menam, upon the borders of the principality of Nan.
If measured by distance on the map, I think that one
would not be far out were one to represent the
kingdom of Luang Prabang as a square of about
seventyfive miles.


The population of the town itself, estimated by
Macleod in 1836 at 5,000, by Pallegoin at 80,000, by
Monhot at 7,000 or 8,000 and by Gamier at 15,000,
strikes me as being nearest to the last mentioned
total. My reasons for thinking so are as follows.

like anything that he has ever seen before. They
make one feel as if one were entering into a world
of itself, one isolated from the rest of the earth, which
has not been made subject to the laws governing
other formations. Standing at the entrance to
Tonkin, this chain of chalk mountains cannot fail
to surprise the traveller, but he is not likely to forget
the two words which are so linked with the name of
the Dong-Trieu, coal operates, representing as they
do the future and the fuel of the colony.


To the left is the small promontory of Cape Doson,
on which stand the Villa Josephine built by Paul
Bert, and several hotels and private houses, the late
Governor of the colony thinking that this promontory
would be a very desirable health resort. His idea
has not been abandoned, and efforts have also been
made to convert it into a fashionable bathing-place.
Concessions were obtained, but these stipulated that
the work of building should be completed within a
given time, and as capital was scarce, many of the
so-called houses were nothing more than mud-huts.
But matters have improved during the last year or
two, and houses of brick or stone are being
substituted for the wretched mud-cabins, hotels are being
erected, a carriage road has been made between
Haiphong and Cape Doson, and there is even a racecourse
being laid out, all that is now wanted being travellers
or colonists with money to spend.


After a few hours steaming up the Cua-Cam, we
cast anchor off Haiphong, the few gunboats of the
French navy aud the German merchant-men being
the only vessels in the river. The entrance to the
port is a very awkward one, and it is gradually

<!-- Leaf 72, Page: 56 -->

What I am about to say is the outcome of an
inquiry, in the course of which information was
supplied to me in abundance, as well as the
embodiment of my own impressions, and of documents
supplied to me from one source and another. It is
difficult to embody in a few pages what would fill
volumes, and all that I can hope to do is to
summarize the opinions of those who seemed
to me the most competent to form one, and to
point out what has been done, what left undone,
and what might still be carried out in Tonkin. My
object is to put my finger upon what is defective as
well as upon what is good, without prejudice or false
pride, and to hold the sores which I have encountered
up to the light of day, as a surgeon would do, in order
to ascertain their cause and discern the proper mode
of treatment. I am not afraid of my sincerity of
motive being called in question, but before
commencing what I have to say, it is incumbent upon
me to thank those who have assisted me in the work
and helped me, in consideration of the object in view,
to get at the truth.


I would fain take this opportunity of saying- to all
the Frenchmen, whom I met in Tonkin, officials,
soldiers, colonists, and j ournalists, how much indebted
I am for their treatment of me. They received me
as an ordinary traveller, as a comrade desirous of
lending them what little help he could by advocating
with his pen the good cause which they had all
embraced, without distinction of party, that is to say
the extension of the French dominions beyond the
ocean.
<!-- Leaf 104, Page: 88 -->
  
  the administration.


It is too numerous; it is partially composed of
iucapables and of men with bad antecedents; it is too
ignorant and meddlesome; it endeavours to raise
difficulties and to check all means of action; for the
most part born of favouritism, it endeavours to indulge
in the same practice and displeases those who obtain
what they apply for as well as those who are passed
over.


There is little need to adduce instances, for all
persons of intelligence who have been in Tonkin
will understand me. I could quote the case of a
clerk sent from Paris by the Under Secretary of State,
rejected by the Governor-General and compelled to
return home, the whole journey being so much out of
the pockets of the tax-payers. Then there is such a
plethora of functionaries that some of them have to
wait at Hanoi or Saigon for several months before
employment can be found for them, while different
posts are invented solely for giving employment to
the 'proteges of senators and the friends of deputies.


What explanation can be offered for the
complicated machinery of administration, for the long list of
functionaries from the junior clerk at the Residency
to the vice-residents and the residents of the first,
second, and third class, or of the scandalous way in
which some of them are promoted to the detriment
of others ?


Will anybody explain why some of them have
been able to obtain £1,200 for cost of transport from
place to place where the commander of an outpost
<!-- Leaf 187, Page: 171 -->
there are merely some scattered huts for the rice
planters.


We do not enter a more populated district until
the evening, when we reach the village of Muong
Chum. The chief's house, wdiere we pass the night, is
recognizable from a distance by the ornaments
formed like stags' antlers, which are placed at the
two extremities of the roof; it is a distinctive sign
which we shall meet with elsewhere. The dwelling is
clean. We have not, as in China, the discomfort of
being surrounded by a curious and annoying crowd,
for the natives are discreet. Our men work well and
each one attends to his own business, the horses are
unsaddled, and while Baptiste gets our meal ready,
Thou attends to the arrangements for the night,
and to the luggage, and Sao prepares the birds that
have been killed during the day. Thou is a good
walker, but finding himself rich for the moment
through some successful gambling with the
sharpshooters in Van Bou, he manifests the intention of
buying a horse. I advise him, while he is about it,
to also take a boy into his service, but he does not
put his idea into practice, and on the following
morning he again starts on foot.


We are awakened at dawn by the monotonous
noise made by women husking the rice underneath
the house; with the foot they move a long wooden
lever, terminated by a kind of hammer, which
regularly falls into the receiver. Some of them are
occupied in this way all the day long, but they work
in relays.


On the road we first pass through a sparsely
inhabited country, which recalls Caophong, with its
<!-- Leaf 315, Page: 299 -->
paid and backed up by his superiors, having- under
his own orders several thousand British proteges and
holding very much the same position as the Siamese
Commissioner here, this latter being everything while
we are nothing.


The native Government acts under the control of
the Commissioner. At the head of it are two kings,
one for peace and the other for war, who reign in
concert. The royalty is hereditary, and, owing to
the existence of polygamy, the royal family is a
numerous one and is related to all the families in the
city. The two reigning kings 1 bear the names of
Chao Kham Souck and Chao Boune Khong (now
called by the Siamese Chao Ratchapha Khinai). Their
father Chao Boune Kham, after a reign of twenty
years, abdicated, and he has now become, at the age
of eighty-two, a sacred personage and more or less of a
demi-god. Below the throne are five ministers.  
  
  
  First Minister... Phya Muong Sene.
Second Minister Phya Muong Chnne.
Third Minister... Phya Maha Sena.
Fourth Minister Phya Muong Koua.
Fifth Minister... Phya Muong Sai.


They are appointed by the kings, and there is an
hereditary assembly called the Sena, to which the
members of certain families belong. The king can
create new7 members, but cannot remove any, and the


1 According to Hallett (p. 32), the kings of Luang Prabang,
like those of Lahon, Lapoon, Pel), and Tern, have only the title of
Chao Huang (great prince), while those of Xieng Mai and Nau
are Chou Che Wit (lord of life). The former are only entitled
to kill criminals by piercing their breasts with a lance, while
thelatter are said to have the right to behead them.
<!-- Leaf 156, Page: 140 -->
up one by one and all the men being required for
each canoe. But as soon as they have got past the
rapid, they stop to fill a hubble-bubble, passing it
round to each other, while others go in search of a
sort of long grasshopper which they collect for food.
It is no use hurrying them, for they must be given
time to blow, so that it often takes two hours to
advance a hundred yards. I employ the interval in
trying to measure the speed of the rapids by means
of small floating bits of wood, but the operation is
a difficult one, and it gives the average speed at about
190 feet a minute. I cannot pretend that it is more
than approximate.


At Tac-da, one of the rapids, we learn that some
canoes were attacked a few clays ago, and higher up
we pass a village called Ban-Thao, the quamlong
(mayor) of which is a woman. That same evening
a path through the woods leads me to a village with
three or four huts, which seems isolated in the midst
of forests and protected by high palisades. Several
men came out as soon as they saw me and made signs
for me to retrace my steps, but whether they took
me for a pirate or not, I cannot say. But in any
case, I think it best to take the hint. In the course
of my excursion I have encountered two very curious
kinds of cemeteries, in the first of which each
burialplace is marked by a small bamboo railing surrounding
a rectangular space; in the centre there is a double
thatched roof with hanging ropes in front to protect
the tomb, which is itself of beaten earth, with three
saucers placed above it, while, on the ground at the
side are a number of faggots and bamboo cages. I only
see a very few graves in the woods, access to which
<!-- Leaf 10, Page: VI -->
muscles and flesh, for it will be more or less his own
work.


Upon starting from Paris at the end of November,
1891, I had two objects in view : first, to complete
in lower Tonkin the information all too hastily
collected at the close of our previous voyage, to
get together further particulars, to examine the work
which had already been accomplished, to see what
remained to be done, and, in short, to engage, so far
as a limit of time and the means at my disposal
allowed, in a sort of inquiry into our situation in
Tonkin. The work was one which could be executed
without much travelling about, in a country relatively
civilised, and all that was needed was to keep one's
eyes and ears open and to be observant of what was
going on.


But—and this was the second object I had in view
—it is difficult to travel so far without making an
excursion, however brief, into the Laos. M. Pavie
had depicted that country to me in such seductive
colours, he had told me of what interesting collections
were to be made and documents to be gleaned that I
felt an irresistible attraction thither. Moreover, a
voyage into Laos would also give me an opportunity
of studying one of the three main commercial routes
to Tonkin, that of the Black River, and enable me
to compare it with that of the Red River, which M.
Bonvalot and myself came down two years ago. I shall
be able to form an idea for myself of one of the outlets
for the trade of Tonkin, which is a good deal talked
about, but of which little is known; and in returning
<!-- Leaf 139, Page: 123 -->
and has only been placed where it is against the time
of its being wanted.


While taking our meals we endeavoured to repay
our hosts' politeness by offering them preserved meats
and coffee in return for their little dishes and their
tea, but one thing struck me very much, namely, that
the chiefs abstain from eating beef. We think that
this must have a common origin with the custom
which prevents beef being eaten by the natives of
India, but the chiefs tell us that they do not care to
eat the same food as the coolies.  
  
  
  January 28th.


The night has been bad, the noise made by the
horses below waking us up continually.
Notwithstanding the fatigue caused by this, we must start
early, as the halting place is a long way off.


The road is a good one, two yards and a half
wide, and one can fancy one's self in a park as
longas one keeps outside the rice plantations, where,
as yesterday, our horses had great trouble in
advancing.


Besides, the cultivated land ceases very soon, and
we are obliged, for fear of running short of drinkable
water, to stop near the last village for breakfast.
Here they bring us drink in bamboo canes four yards
long with pierced knobs. In helping with the
preparations of the meal, I cannot help thinking of the
variety and multiplicity of services rendered us by
the bamboo. Does there exist on earth another
plant so generally useful to humanity ? I do
not know of one. For my own part I could
<!-- Leaf 238, Page: 222 -->
water and saffron stand before the al car; a chicken
plucked but not cooked is laid upon a cup, this is
removed when the old man has left.  
  
  
  March 7th.


AVe continue the descent through the woods, and
find ourselves obliged to walk all the way. This
stage takes us to a village consisting of a few houses
inhabited by some Yans. They are cousins of the
Thais (their dialects are similar), but they dress like
the Chinese; the women have a blue turban which
crosses in front and recalls the bow worn by the
Alsacians. Like the Yaos, they build upon the
ground itself. I notice some papers and some
inscriptions in Chinese characters, and find that the majority
of the people understand this language, wThich Cam
Koui speaks to them. They tell us that they came
here two or three years ago from Phong-Tho (in the
province of Loa-Kay). Some of them have a red
circle upon the forehead, marked by the
cuppingglasses which they use for headache.


Fishing is their principal industry. I see cast nets,
hand nets, and small wicker traps hanging on the
walls. They have gardens surrounded by palisades
in which fennel, garlic, cabbages, turnips, white
radishes, and a plant with large leaves upon which
they feed the pigs, seem the vegetables chiefly
cultivated.


Whilst we are installing ourselves a caravan of
eighteen mules passes by; their load is placed upon
a small wooden saddle, which is balanced upon a pack
saddle without a girth. This method of loading is
used in Yunnam and Setchuen. Each animal carries
<!-- Leaf 100, Page: 84 -->
who are interested in the questions relating to the
Far East, and to whom our national honour is dear,
will have learnt quite enough from the newspapers.
The renewal of friendly relations with the Court of
Annam, the reconciliation effected by the governor
of that court with the Kinh-luoc, who had until then
compromised his safety by siding with us, the
dangerous arming of an Annamite guard placed at
the disposal of the mandarins, and the strange
bickerings arising out of personal questions between
civilians and soldiers of the same country, are facts
of too great gravity to remain unknown.


During the eight years that we have governed the
country, there has been an endless succession of
changes, contradictions in the lines of conduct of
the different governors, and often in the acts of the
same one. In these circumstances, so far is it from
being extraordinary that piracy exists, the wonder is
that the country should be comparatively quiet, for
we have to do with the Semites, whose immobility for
hundreds of years is such a strange problem to us.
The Annamites, in particular, have been subject,
without themselves being in any way altered, to
many different yokes, and they say to themselves that
the. French, like others who have been before them,
more even than others, will disappear in their turn.
They bestir themselves and they wait.


It is high time for us to know what we wish to do,
and what we can do, to make no bones about it,
and to add practice to theory, incurring the necessary
sacrifices, and conforming invariably to a steady course
of policy, the main lines of which would be
administrated for us by men of experience. There is no lack
<!-- Leaf 321, Page: 305 -->
or a bunch of flowers. Their dress, as a rule, consists
only of a sheet, that is to say of a piece of blue cloth
passing between the legs and fastened round the
waist, the women wearing a turban, a loose vest, and
a short petticoat. The Kas of Luang Prabang appear
to be very shy, and I could not induce them, even by
the promise of presents, to let me photograph them,
the only means by which I succeeded being an order
from the Siamese Colonel, while, when brought up,
they were so intimidated that I could count their
pulses beating at more than eighty to the minute.
AVhen walking- in the streets they proceed as if they
were afraid that some one was going to hurt them,
and, being more laborious if less educated than the
Laotians, they are employed by the latter to fashion
the metals, to look after the stock and to cultivate the
soil, so that they fill much the same part that the
Lacædemonians of old did, except that they are not so
badly used.


In former times the men of the conquering race
made inroads into the Kas villages and carried off a
number of the inhabitants as slaves, the males
being seized in preference to the females, while with
the people of the plain the reverse was the case. Now
the king has abolished slavery in theory, though in
reality it still exists;l but the armed raids are not of
frequent occurrence. Here, as is the case with certain
European nations upon the coast of Africa, who claim


1 Slavery as practised upon the Kas is regarded as legal
among the Laotians; a father who is poor and has a large
family, often sells one or two of his sons, at the rate of fifteen
rupees if they are very young, and of from twenty to forty for
adults. They are then employed as boatmen.

palace with its oriental roof; the marble staircases,
the chandeliers, the gilded decorations, the spacious
galleries where foreign ministers are received, near the
stables in which are lodged, cared for, served, adored as
gods the so-called white elephants; the great storie
barracks in front of which little soldiers parade in European
dress; the tramways and cabs which carry you
across fine and spacious streets with shops on
wellconstructed bridges to the native quarters, where one
can get about only on foot among winding alleys,
which form the centre of the native commerce, with
gaming houses and houses of prostitution; the
population itself, composed of a small number of
Europeans—English, Danes, Germans and French—of
Siamese, Chinese, Annamites, Malays and Hindoos,
wearing the most varied dresses: all these sights
and sounds contribute to make Bangkok one of the
strangest, one of the most heteroclite towns, that I
have seen in the far East. It is a curious object to
study. Some parts in themselves are beautiful and
picturesque under the proper light. But the whole
leaves the impression of a great picture, composed
by painters of every school, where each artist has
followed his individual bent. It is an orchestra
without a theme, in which each player indulges his own
fancy, a cacophany.


Such is the impression left upon me by Bangkok.
The town is well known, and has been often described.
It is so easy to get there now that the trip is a
pleasure trip, a bridal tour. Amidst its incoherence it
includes some curiosities of the first order, even some
chef d'œuvres, one of which deserves to be better
known. This is the Vishnu of the museum, but I
leave the description of it to others.

large green jecko (cordylus), about a cubit long and
three fingers wide, ocellated with beautiful spots of
azure blue; a great insect destroyer, but quite
harmless to man, by whom it is regarded as a friend.  
  
  
  April 1st.


Our boatmen remove the foliage which decorates
the front of our pirogues; we have passed all the
rapids—at least for the time. The country seems
more populated, and the river banks are cultivated;
I see some tobacco plantations, which appear
wellkept; they are surrounded by palisades.


AVe still meet with fishing-rafts; but here the
terraces support round huts with a rectangular
opening in front; the bamboos are arranged above them
to meet the current with a corner only, so that they
should not catch the detritus, which w-ould otherwise
accumulate. From a distance, the effect of these
buildings is rather like an enlarged beaver village,
and we can imagine that the lacustral dwellings, of
which so many remains are found in European lakes,
must have resembled them closely.


AVe pass rafts laden with rice, in the middle two
straw mats are connected by a roof; there is a little
terrace in front and another at the back. The whole
is fifteen yards long, and the Kas boatmen slowly row
them dowm the stream.


Some calcareous cliffs rise on our right and partially
overhang the river; their base is worn away by the
water, and birds fly in and out of the fissures. The
wall is about ten yards high, and is ornamented with
inscriptions and primitive red drawings.
<!-- Leaf 137, Page: 121 -->
tea, but I do not care to take any, though I am
told they are very cooling to the blood.


Each visit takes about a quarter of an hour, at
the most, as we must reach Thac-By by nightfall,
and around some of the houses I notice high
palisades of bamboos, at least eighteen feet high, filled
with laths inside, while the outside is protected by
sharp pointed stakes.


As we go along the road we see several squares of
interwoven bamboos hanging from the top of a tall
reed, each square having at one of its angles several
rings one inside the other, these being intended to
keep off the evil spirits.


The vdlage of Thac-By was celebrated at the time
of the conquest of Tonkin, and up to 1887 it was
occupied by the Black Flags, who directed their
incursions into the Song-Bo from there.


They have now been all driven off, and the country
is quite quiet. The neighbourhood is a very pretty
one, clumps of flower-bearing trees of white camellias
reaching a height of over sixteen feet, areca-nut trees
and cocoa trees surrounding the houses, while the last
rays of the sun, reflected by the rice-fields, play
among their foliage. It is a peaceful scene as the
natives come in from the fields with their animals,
and as the bright-plumaged birds flit about among
the trees, and the two hours which we spend there
before nightfall pass all too quickly.


The chief who accords us his hospitality belongs to
the ancient sovereign family of the Zinhs, and his
age and origin secure for him deep respect on all
sides, while, on account of his influence, it is our
interest to gain his attachment, so that the visit
<!-- Leaf 225, Page: 209 -->
treaty with Deo Van Tri, and the latter is to
forward to him annually 6,000 piculs of tea from Ibang.
The chief has fifty mules, and can hire as many more.
Three months ago sixty piculs were sent off, and while
wre were at Van Bou another 100 piculs were
despatched; 120 more will start in a few days. M.
Bourgoing Meiffre pays thirty-four piastres and a half
for each picul delivered at Hanoi, that is about one
shilling- the pound. The French merchant can sell
the tea on the spot, in China, at Canton, or perhaps
even send it into France. The leaves require scenting
before they suit the public taste, but the expense
will be very small compared to the enormous benefits
which the reduction of the custom duties gives to
our colonial productions.


On the whole Deo Van Tri is satisfied with his
bargain, for the transport costs him very little, since
his pirogues must go clown to fetch up supplies of
food for the posts, and the profits on the tea trade
now compensate him for the losses that he has
made on opium and cotton. This last article, which
we are told formerly sold for thirty piastres the picul
at Mongtze, is not worth more than twenty piastres
there now, and as it costs fourteen at Laichau the
difference is not sufficiently remunerative, after the
freight has been paid.


Besides his commerce, his continual excursions to
the right and left, and his voyages, the Thao (as Deo
Van Tri is surnamed in his house) is passionately
devoted to hunting. The hounds are thick-set, generally
fawn-coloured, with black noses and short tails; from
twenty to thirty of them are requisitioned in the
neighbourhood. They are fastened in groups in the  
  
  
  p
<!-- Leaf 252, Page: 236 -->
too much for them, they cross their tops, so that we
could believe we were passing under the arches of a
natural cathedral. Every kind of architecture is
represented. Here are rounded pillars, others
ornamented with arris; there is the ogive, and further on
the semi-circular, traves and architraves, low, damp,
gloomy vaults and high, bold, graceful arches, full of
daylight; nothing could be stranger than this timber
work, erected by nature, to support a canopy of verdure,
which shelters travellers from the rays of the
glowingsun. Masters of the soil where they have grown, the
bamboos seem to have driven all other plants away;
for the ground is clear, and walking is easy and
pleasant under them.


In the distance we see some oaks and trees with
pink flowers, which recall Judas trees; large glades
open in the midst of the woods and in crossing them
we have some good opportunities of shooting. The
flowers attract the birds, which fly amongst the
branches in search of insects, like a swarm of bees
seeking for honey. The country is full of game; traces
of deer are on all sides; some large animals take flight
at our approach. Sao seized a AVinchester and is
lucky enough to kill a fine stag (Rusa aristotelis);
it is taller and larger than any of the stags of France.
AVe stop to cut it up at once, for we are short of fresh
meat, and not at all averse to varying our bill of fare,
which always consists of eggs and chickens. Our chef
having put some pieces on one side, the coolies divide
the remainder among them, wrapping their share in
banana leaves to keep it fresh. This unexpected
windfall puts the whole party in good spirits; Sao
receives a perfect ovation, and we start with renewed
<!-- Leaf 300, Page: 284 -->

A little further on the valley of Nam Ou opens and
the river meets a stream of water of the same width
quickly flowing between banks of low rocks, with
small hills rising behind them. The new river is not
unknown to us, for weare now on the Mekong. This
is the third time that I have seen this stream, the
powerful artery of the Indo-Chinese peninsula. I
feel a certain pleasure in again meeting these waters,
which come down from the mountains of Thibet we
crossed two years ago, above Tsiamdo, and which will
empty themselves into the ocean after they have
fertdized the delta of Cochin-China The Zatchow, lower
down Lang Tsan Kiang, is here called Nam Kong or
Meh Nam Kong, which Europeans have converted
into Mekong. I cannot pronounce the name of Mekong
without connecting with it some recollection of
Doudart de Lagree, of Gamier, and, of the members of
tbe Pavie Mission, some thoughts of all the devotion
and courage shown by those who have risked their
lives in exploring the great river, believing that they
were working for France.


Has De Lagree then only succumbed in China to
the fatigues of his patriotic enterprise, in order that
the Siamese and English should reap the fruit of his
labours ? Shall we never see the French flao- waving
freely at the stern of gunboats ascending the valley
of Cambodia as far as the Sibsom Panas ?


Memories of the past and hopes for the future are
making me neglect the present; I forget where we are,
and it is not until some minutes later, upon putting
my hand in the water, I notice the coldness of the
new stream. There is a marked difference between
the temperature of the waters of the Mekong and of
<!-- Leaf 255, Page: 239 -->
Thene Fagna Lie (a man from heaven) perceived
these two charming young girls bathing. He remained
thoughtful for a moment, seeking some means of
finding a drug of exquisite perfume.


"This drug was nothing but the fruit of a fig-tree.
He let it fall into the current and pass before the young
girls; they cut it in two and each of them eat one
half.


\"Having eaten, the elder gave birth to a boy,
named Khoune Lou, and the younger had a girl called
Nang Hou.


\"Khoune Lou and Nang Hou loved each other
from their birth, and they promised to marry. But
Nang Ngin Lieang would not allow her daughter
to wed Khoune Lou. She thought that it would
create a scandal, as the betrothed were such near
relations. She therefore accepted the first comer for
her daughter, and gave her to Khoune Chai, who
lived at Muong-Mou, and who had asked for her in
marriage. Nang Hou could not love Khoune Chai;
she said that if she could not be Khoune Lou's wife
she would die. The poor girl's heart was on fire; she
fled into the forest and there she grasped her throat
so tightly that she died. Khoune Lou had the same
feeling; he left his home, and walked knife in hand
to the place where Nang Hou had died; there he
stabbed himself with the knife and fell dead.


\"The mothers of these poor children went to
fetch the bodies and carried them home to burn
them; they performed various ceremonies and built
a pyramid, so that the remainder of the bones might
be preserved in it."

conversing with one who was employed by M.
Counillon, the French consul. He was a man of
small stature, but well proportioued, with very pale
complexion and regular features, and he told me that
the Meos originally came from China and could make
themselves understood by the caravan-men from the
Yunnam. I gathered from his expressions that the
Meos dialect is very like that of Van Bou, the word
Meos, being rather the Laos designation, while they
call themselves Mongs. I do not know whether this
name has any connection with that of the ancient
empire ofthe Mongs and the Mons of Burmah, but,
according to the man with whom I conversed, the
tribes to which he belongs have no religious creeds,
though there is a word in his language which denotes
the Deity. The marriages are arranged by the
parents, a young girl being rated at 36 rupees and
taken, as soon as she is married, to the house of her
husband. The bodies of the defunct are interred three
days after death.


With regard to the few Chinese, they form a colony
apart at Luang Prabang, devoting their energies to
the trade in rice, salt and European fancy goods
brought from Bangkok, no caravans from the Yunnam
coming this far.


Having given these particulars as to the kingdom
of Luang Prabang, its limits, its inhabitants, its
administration and its future, I must now say
something about the town and what we saw there.


During the fortnight of our stay we employed
our time in much the same way. We spent the
morning and fore part of the day upon the left
bank, visiting everything that was to be seen in
<!-- Leaf 394, Page: 378 -->
selves in the mineral kingdom. For some time we
cross sandstone traversed by calcareous bands in
which I find some fossils. Elsewhere we discover in
great abundance iron ore spherical in shape like small
gun shot.


One afternoon I notice along the way heaps of
stones with rectangular bases, the large axis
perpendicular to us, and with bits of wood on the sides. A
little farther on small circular heaps surround the base
of the trees. AVe finally succeed in getting the
information from our men^that the spirit of a sorcerer dwells
there, and that, when people pass, they throw stones
lest he should trouble them.


This custom reminds me of the obos so frequent in
Central Asia and Thibet. The Siamese soldiers tell us
that no such thing exists in Siam. AVe are here on
the territory of Pitchai, which is directly dependent on
Bangkok, but with a Laotian population and Laotian
in its manners.


The incidents are not frequent enough to alleviate
the monotony of the route, and it is with genuine
satisfaction that we quit the forests. In the
cultivated country we sleep in the solas or inns, and there
we sometimes have interesting experiences.


On April 26th we stop at a house which serves
the double purpose of inn and pagoda, sharing the
common room with Burma merchants. They are
men of fair complexion, wearing a turban which
leaves uncovered a small chignon. An old man has
his ears pierced like the Khas.


Our companions have come from Muang Pay to sell
their stuffs here, and they are now on their way
home. They are tattooed in blue from the knee to
<!-- Leaf 44, Page: 28 -->

We have reached an immense harbour shut in by
lofty walls, the work of nature, while in the
background a series of rolling hills indicates the direction
of the mainland. Upon the slopes of one of these
hills there are to be seen several trim and
wellbuilt white houses, and at the foot a sort of pier
running out into the sea, with a line of rails over
which the trucks are carrying out the coal extracted
from the pits close to the shore. The tricolor
floats above the pits, and here, at Hong-Hay, an
important mining centre is rapidly forming, a town
is springing up, a quay has been built and the means
of communication are being opened. A homogeneous
plan has been traced by men of intelligence, there
has been no lack of money to carry it out, and
nothing has been neglected to ensure success.


The difficulties, nevertheless, have been very
great, the first having been raised by our
representatives, and by our administrative system which is
always very slow in sanctioning a sound affair. I
would call the reader's attention to the dates : the
first demand for a concession was sent in to the
administration in 1881, but it was not finally
granted until 1888. Although the Hong-Hay
coalfields had been talked about for the last fifteen
years, they were visited for the first time in the
spring of 1881 by M. Mourin d'Arfeuille, the
temporary consul of France at Haiphong, and, by
arrangement with him, M. Blustein, manager of the
Saigon steam-tramways, sent in, on the 9th of
September, a demand for a concession of the
coalfields in the province of Quang-Yen, to the
son-inlaw of Duong-Hing, at the place called Ha-lam.

falling unknown, without reward or glory.
Unfortunately it has been impossible for me to go
amono-st our non-commissioned officers in barracks in
France, but I have seen them at work far away, and
wherever I have been in Tonkin I have found them
steadfast, devoted, courageous, in a word, really fine
men. I am anxious to make this statement as
publicly as possible.

Our new pirogues are smaller than those in which
we came, but the boatmen are equally good. The
country becomes wilder as we ascend the river, and
we do not see any more vdlages. The stream is about
one hundred yards wide and very winding; on the
left it receives an affluent, the Nam-Mou. The banks
are often formed of a small sandy beach bordered with
reeds where the tracks of animals of every kind cross
each other in great numbers—tigers (of which I see
very large foot-marks), deer, peacocks, &c. We fire
at a jungle cock, and from a distance, so that we are
not able to hit them, at a band of large black gibbons.
They were seated upon a rock motionless as statues,
and at our shots they flee into the woods without
a cry.

When we awake a whitish mist floats above the
river, apparently gliding and moving upon the
surface; the rising sun soon gilds it with its first
rays, and it then resembles a large veil of gauze, put
on through coquetry.

cost of an intermediary, and to pay, by reason of its
bargain with him, a commission of eighteen per cent.
or £12,000, which might have been saved. There
were plenty of indications to show how much the
State would lose by this course, but no heed seems to
have been paid to them, and the instructions received
by letter from the Under Secretary of State were in
many instances contradictory, and placed the resident
engineers in a most embarrassing position.


Such being the mode of purchase, it remains to be
seen what was the material used. In the first place,
the gauge adopted was that of two feet, though, as a
Dutch engineer whom I met, remarked : " Neither in
the English Colonies, nor in our own is a gauge of less
O J o o
than three feet four inches adopted, especially upon
lines of over sixty miles in length, as the rolling stock
wears out too quickly; moreover, with a line
traversing a mountainous country and an incline of one in
thirty-three the narrow-gauge system cannot have more
than three carriages to a train. The forty-inch gauge
has even been used in Tonkin for private
undertakings, such as the Hong-Hay collieries, so that
there is all the more reason for adopting it over long
lines.''


With regard to the quality of the rolling stock,
some of the engines and carriages which had been
O O
used at the Exhibition had been sent over, and even
if they were all in good condition, which I believe is
not the case, they would be open to the objection of
being unsuitable to warm climates.

When a question was asked in the Paris Chamber
of Deputies on November 27, 1890, with regard to
the railway between Phulang-Tuong and Langson, the

grottoes visible up to a great height, while black
portions of the rock, harder than the rest and w-ashed
by the rain, hang in gigantic stalactites.


In vain I search with my glass the nooks and
corners in the hope of finding a pagoda. There are
no statues, but at about 160 feet from the top, on
a white surface, I make out a sort of escutcheon,
filled with small rows of Buddhas.


This rock is called Pakao (the white rock). A Kha,
runs the tradition, having ventured upon the summit
to look at the river, was carried over the edge by a
strong wind, and touched the water. But far from
being killed he swam for some miles clown stream and
was received by the canoes of a village. The
inhabitants, marvelling at what had occurred, fell prostrate
before the Kha, gave him presents and named him
their king.


On the right bank, the village of Muong Liep
(Diap on the map), once important, now possesses
only a few houses. The gardens are full of fruit
trees, cocoa trees, areca nut trees, oranges, bananas,
and the mak tan ta late} which are eaten with a
spoon.


AVe cannot buy any rice, the inhabitants having
very little. They got it from Nam Ou, or certain
villages especially given to its growth.


In front of the huts pods gathered from the trees
are drying, full of seeds which are surrounded by a
silky clown like those of some of our poplars. It is
known as nghioue, and it is used here for pillows and
mattresses.  
  
  
  I note, also, on the dryers, tobacco in shreds.

personages. The work of administration is more
difficult than in France, on account of its special
character, and this is an additional reason for not
supposing that those who are useless at home
will do for the colony. On the contrary, the
personnel intended for Tonkin should be recruited
with special care, and candidates should be expected
to possess, in addition to good education, experience,
moral virtue, and special capacities. When an
applicant is found to possess these necessary qualities,
he should be left free to show what he is capable of
by allowing him to occupy the same post for a
reasonable period.


However capable he may be, what possible chance
can an unfortunate official have who is always on the
eve of being shifted ? What is the use of his
attempting to get well acquainted with his subordinates, to
form a body of police, to encourage the colonists, or
to make any experiments ?


Is he not to be excused if he often exhibits very little
zeal in his post and just lets things slide ? Most of
the errors committed are to be imputed not to him
but to the powers above him. If an official does not
feel himself backed up, he will not show any energy,
for in matters of colonization, as in others, " like master
like man." Without needing to go so far afield as
the English colonies, we have one which has been for
a long time admirably administered, and that is
Cochin-China. The organization which has made it
so prosperous is due to Admiral de la Grandiere; and
{empty}M. de Lanessan, in one ofthe chapters of his book on
Indo-China, explains the nature of that organization
and points out the errors which have been committed
<!-- Leaf 69, Page: 53 -->
the Europeans. The lake awakens recollections greatly
prized by the Annamites, those of the independence
which they won by their victory over the Chinese.
The legend attaching to the lake of the great sword
(hoam-Kiem-he) is that in 1418, when Annam was
under the Chinese 5-oke, a fisherman, Le-loi,
havingcast his nets into the lake, drew out a long sword.
Taking this to be a presage from heaven, he got up
a rising against the Chinese, who, after ten years'
struggle, abandoned Annam. The liberator,
havingbeen crowned king by his companions, decided that
a sacrifice should be made to thank the gods for their
goodness. The preparations for this sacrifice having
been completed, the sword which had guided them to
victory was carried with great pomp to the shore,
but the ceremony had barely begun when the sword
leapt from its scabbard and changed into a dragon,
which at once leapt in the water and was seen no
more.


This was at once recognised to be the genius of the
lake and a pagoda was built in his honour.


The lake may be said to form the boundary of the
native town, which lies between the citadel and the
river. The Annamites build like the Chinese and
arrange their shops in the same way, while they have
streets occupied by particular trades. In front of
the shops are large red placards, with names in gold
letters and Chinese characters, but the streets are
broader and more spacious, so that, despite the density
of the population, there is no difficulty in getting
about in a pousse-pousse. Upon market days, the
crowd is very great and the spectacle a curious one,
and long files of women go by carrying their goods
<!-- Leaf 409, Page: 393 -->

From Bangkok a royal yacht takes us to the island
of Kosi Chang, situated at the mouth of the Menam.
This is one ofthe king's summer residences, and it is
here that he receives me. I have nothing but thanks
to express for his kind reception, as well as for the
conduct of the Siamese governors along the Menam.
I think that I ought to take this opportunity of
replying to a reproach constantly brought against me
since my departure by the English press of Siam. It
has expressed surprise because, after having been
well treated by the Siamese Government, I protested
against the encroachments of the latter in the
direction of the Mekong. It has called me ungrateful,
ignorant of the laws of hospitality, and a stripling,
and has applied to me other titles not less flattering.
I am anxious to thank the Siamese Government for its
conduct towards me. I shall preserve pleasant memories
of the personal relations I had with the governors,
the ministers, and the king; their amiability and
their politeness were assuredly dictated by a feeling
of courtesy, to which I am glad here to render homage.
But I hope, for their sake, that in practising towards
me as largely as possible the laws of hospitality, they
did not for a moment do me the insult to imagine
that in return I should conceal from my compatriots
what I had been able personally to discover during my
journey: namely the advance of the Siamese towards
our possessions, the occupation, in defiance of all
right, of Annamite territories, the bad treatment
inflicted on many of our fellow-citizens, the flagrant
violation of treaties.


I spoke of what I knew. I cried "gare/" ("beware!")
and do not regret having done so; and it is at once
our right and our duty to continue urging our claims

  April 22nd.


Our elephants having been brought to us at an
early hour, we load them immediately and set out.


Our convoy comprises seven animals, smaller than
those we had in India. Ours carry only 100 tchangs
{2\ cwt.). They are owned by a few families and
not by the vdlagers in common. An animal fifteen
years old is worth from six to seven tchangs, or from
about 480 to 560 rupees. The one I am riding is
valued at 640 rupees. The elephants require much
care, which is the more readily given them as they
represent a fortune for their owners. They are liable
to fall ill and suffer particularly from diarrhœa.
They are then treated with indigo and sugar cane.


Each elephant has two men to tend it. They take
turns in driving it, in riding on its neck and in
walking- behind it. The man who walks behind often
lops off small branches for the animal to eat. At
night, one of them sleeps near the aoudah, while the
other remains with the elephant. Our saddles are
attached to the animals, but changed several times a
night to allow them to feed on the pastures.


I am pleased to find again these good big beasts with
which I passed such a pleasant month in India.
Although the keepers appear to me to be kinder here,
the elephants are less intelligent, or rather not so well
trained; for, as elsewhere, they were captured wild.
They are not very prolific in India when domesticated,
but in Cambodia, on the contrary, our interpreter
says, they are more so. The father of Takiate who
has owned two for the last fifteen years, has had a
young one which he sold to the king.

  ON THE BLACK RIVElt BELOW VAN-YEN, FEBRUARY 3llD, 1892
<!-- ComposedBlock (picture?) skipped here P149_CB00001 -->

<!-- Leaf 98, Page: 82 -->
This state of affairs did not last long, but it had
led to the surprise of several outposts and to the
death of a great many soldiers. A little later, we
find the organization of the country making slow
progress, with occasional hostilities between the civil
and the military, until the arrival of M. de Lanessan.
It seemed then as if an era of contentment was about
to begin; roads were made, military territories, the
formation of which had been asked for in the reports
of M. Bonnat, buried away, no doubt, in the
pigeonholes, of the administration, were at last created,
columns were formed in the Dong-Trieu and the
YenThe, and a system of maritime defence was organized.
It seemed, indeed, as if Tonkin was going to be
administered by a governor with more intelligence
than his predecessors. But if we skip a few months
what do we find but promises unfulfilled,
halfmeasures and a lack of continuity ? In regard to the
formation of military territories, the advice of
experienced men was only partly followed, and their
plans were in many cases lost before they had been
examined. Despite the express opinion ofthe colonel
commanding the Black Eiver territory, the region
between the Red River and its right tributary was
only embodied in a single command after the capture
of the Yen-lang post by the notorious Doc-Ngu. Not
till then was the anomaly suppressed by which the
lands included within the angle of the two rivers were
under three different controls, one of these being a
civil authority. The consequence was that the pirates
passed with impunity from one region into another;
and it was not until a captain and six men had
been massacred that the administration realized the
<!-- Leaf 89, Page: 73 -->
ministration did not hesitate a moment to waste upon
this useless enterprise, for 150 miles of roads already
in existence, the 370,000 piastres which represented
the redemption tax upon forced labour. If to this
sum of £60,000 are added the dilapidations committed
by the Mandarins along these roads, which are now
sinking into the morasses and rice-fields, to say
nothing of the loss sustained by the natives, whose
property was taken without any sort of compensation,
you can guess what the work has cost per mile, both
to us and them."


This, in my view, is too pessimist an estimate of the
situation, a remark which also applies to the objection
that these new roads facilitate the circulation of
pirates. Defective as they may be, these roads must,
it seems to me, be of service to cultivation and
trade, and, therefore, in the long run to the
pacification of the country.


I was invited to the opening of the
HaidZuong route, which starts from the left bank of the
river, just above Hanoi. Only recently finished, the
road seems a good one, though it has not yet been
put to the test of the summer rains. The district it
traverses is one of lonely morasses, which in a year's
time will be replaced by fertile rice fields—a result
which has already been obtained between
PhulangTuang and Kep. From a military point of view
these roads are of more service to our troops than to the
pirates, who naturally prefer to see the military posts
isolated from one another, narrow and steep footpaths,
known only to the natives, answering the purpose
of those who indulge in guerilla warfare, better
than open roads, along which it is not necessary to
<!-- Leaf 400, Page: 384 -->
to work, that is to pile up wealth. All the force of
his nature, all the means at the disposal of his
intelligence tend only to one end, to make money,
as the English say. Thus there is no reason to be
surprised if he is the master of trade, of gaming, of
opium, and of the taxes, exploiting the virtues as
w-ell as the vices of the natives, with the good pleasure
ofthe government to which he pays his tithe.
Considered as a foreigner, the Chinese is more favoured
than the Siamese, merely paying a capitation tax of
from three to four ticals every three years, which
does not prevent him, however, from lamenting his
lot.


The interests of trade attach him to the state,
which has no reason to dread his practising piracy.
Several years ago, some Chinamen who worked at the
Bangkok rice mill formed secret societies, but w-ere
put down and dispersed by the Siamese soldiers,
and order was restored. The danger for Siam in
permitting the development of the Chinese element
is of another order. It is the same always, caused
by the invasion of this race when it finds itself in
the presence of a population weaker than itself, as
is the case in Tonkin,—namely the demoralization
of the inferior races, the absorption of all the
riches of the country, or the methodical draining
off of all its money and the substitution of foreign
intelligence for that of the native inhabitants. It is
in short the victory of the stronger over the weaker
who is in the end utterly devoured.


AA^ith the Chinese we experience again the insolent
self-sufficiency which we already know, and that
intolerable curiosity, which makes the traveller
<!-- Leaf 154, Page: 138 -->
surwas three parts under water, and only owing his life
to a lucky chance, this experience being one that he
was not at all anxious to repeat. There being no
village for us to halt at, the men pass the night on a
sand bank. They are not long in running themselves
up a shelter with bamboos and palm leaves, and the
fires being lighted and the pot-au-feu got ready
we converse more cheerfully than w7e did in the
morning, when our boys, and especially our
interpreters, felt the reverse of easy. Nowt they make
light of the pirates, having got out of danger. We
are told that the Doc-Ngu is very powerful, that at
a sign from him 2,000 men would leap to arms, that
ten chiefs are ready to do his bidding, that a sorcerer
accompanies him and tells him during- each expedition
the propitious moment for the chances of success by
immolating a fowl and examining its claws, this being
regarded as an infallible test. They are not agreed as
to the outcome of our journey, reports being current that
Deo Van Tri had been assassinated by the Siamese
that were in his service, and that the occurrence had
been kept secret out of fear of an invasion from
Laos. It is rumoured also that the highlands are in
a very disturbed state; but I know with what reserve
stories of this kind are to be credited, and I shall get
to learn the truth later on.


I take advantage of the friendly disposition of our
staff to endeavour to get information as to the
customs and religious creeds of the country, and the
interpreter of M. Vacle, excited by a drop of
tchoumtchoum, proposes by way of winding up the evening,
to tell us a story, which was much as follows :—

a bamboo with a mat at the end of it shaped like a
lotus leaf. Following him comes a cortege of bonzes
and students in yellow, belonging to six pagodas,
singing in chorus or making response to one another,
while at an interval of about fifty yards, a number
of young girls march in regular order, the smallest
coming first. They all have a yellow scarf over
their dress, aud each has a parasol according to
her size, from the tiny European sunshades to the
vast Chinese umbrellas of oiled paper, and each of
them carries a silver jar full of flowers for the
pagodas or of water for the libations. Picturesque
as this spectacle is, it is not the most curious part of
this " festival of the women," as it might well be
called.


AVomen sprinkle water over the chief bonze, and
others bolder still, come and pour the contents of
their jar over some young student. This custom of
sprinkling or pouring water, which is also to be met
with at certain festivals in Siam and Burmah, would
not be so surprising if it were confined to the priests,
but here the girls pick up mud and plaster the faces
of the young men, whoever they may be, and our
white dresses tempt them so much that we are
obliged to assume a very stern look in order to keep
them at a distance. The young men, however, are
too gallant to resent these attentions, and as for the
bonzes, they get something better than water offered
them, as presents are made them in the shape of pans
full of food, which are handed to two men who
accompany the chair.


AVhen the procession reaches Ouate Sieng Tong, it
enters the courtyard, and the bonzes, after reciting
<!-- Leaf 431, Page: 415 -->
Yunnam-Sen, and beyond Lunghay, the Yangtze,
and Houi-li-Tcheou, into south-western Setchuen;
eastward towards Quong-Nan-Fou, namely the
populous region stretching across three provinces,
Yunnam, Kouitchou, and Kouang-Si.


Tlie main rational and practical route for the
French to penetrate into China is that of the valley
of the Red River, at the extremity of which are
situated two depots; Lao-kai on French territory,
and on Chinese territory Mungtze.1


It is the shortest and best route from the coasts to
the capital of Yunnam.


While there is unanimity in recognising the Red
River route as the shortest, some authors have refused
to recognise the use which may be made of its valley
even from the point of view of the navigability of the
river. They have even expressed some doubts as to
the possible value of the trade to be developed.
Among this number is to be counted M. de Lanessan.


\"Little by little," he wrote in 1889, " the illusions
that were held some years ago on the importance of
Tonkin as a means of getting to China are
beingdissipated. We begin to see that the Red River is a
very bad tvay of penetration into Yunnam; that the
portion of Yunnam bordering upon Tonkin is not so
rich as it was formerly thought to be; that the
Langson route towards Quang-Si can hardly compete with
that of the Canton River and its tributaries, and that
the real source of prosperity for Tonkin is, as in
lower Cochin-China, the Delta rice-fields."


In the course of my remarks I have, it seems to
me, met these objections fairly enough. The most

General de Trentinian, the French governor,
promised to back it up with the Annamite
government, the coal having been experimented on board
the Carabine.


At the end of 1881, two engineers, M. Fuchs and
{empty}M. Saladin, were appointed by the Minister of
Marine to explore the coal-fields and to report upon
them. M. Fuchs stated in his report that M.
d'Arfeuille had discovered the layer of coal known
as the Jaureguiberry mine, and the Minister of
Marine, in a despatch addressed to the Consul of
France at Haiphong, informed him that Annam
was only to grant concessions to French citizens
(March 22, 1882), and at the same time transmitted
{empty}M. d'Arfeuille's application to M. Lemyre de Vilers
for him to deal with. The applicants, whose renewed
demands are met with fair promises, fail however to get
any definite reply, and so matters go on until June 26,
1884, when M. d'Arfeuille and M. de Turenne (M.
Blustein having died in the interim) again ask for
a concession of the basin of the Hong-Hay, where
the presence of coal has been distinctly traced.


The situation has undergone a change, for the
protectorate of France over Annam has been
recognised by the treaty of Hue (June 6, 1884), the
eighteenth clause of which stipulates that " subsequent
conferences will regulate the question of the mines
and their working." A commission appointed for this
purpose drew up a project which appeared in the
Ofjiciel of December 6, so that M. d'Arfeuille might
well hope, after three years of fruitless efforts, that he
had at last succeeded.  
  
  
  But this was not to be, for between the time of his

  That eveuing no one goes to the village : it is not

there is nothing to do there.  
  
  
  AVe all remain talking in the sala. Some candles

have been made of yellow wax (sold in disks), which
the men roll round a cotton wick by rubbing them
both between their hands; the light is good. In the
distance, the cpuais utter their hoarse belling, and it
is comfortable to feel that we are under shelter, when,
after a good dinner, we sit round a bright fire
enjoying a pipe. AVe no longer hear the gradual crescendo of
the giant frog, that came and lulled us to sleep in Upper
Tonkin. This melody is replaced by music of another
kind. In the middle of the night we are suddenly
awakened by a loud voice, which sounds from a corner of
the room, from the ceiling, or from a neighbouring tree :  
  
  
  Tako, tako ken, ken, ken oh, oh, followed

by a kind of hoarse laugh. The first time it is heard,
we are astonished, and find some difficulty in sleeping
again; we look about but cannot discover anything.
After a little while, we become accustomed to the
songs of the hidden guest, who speaks at night in
every Laotian house. The natives know it well;
sometime they see it and point it out during the
clay, but they respect it as a sacred being, a
household friend. An idea of protection, a veneration
that is even a little superstitious, is attached to its  
  
  
  presence in a house... I see that in speaking of

the singer I am acquainted with, I have forgotten
the important point of introducing it to the reader.
The tahou (so called by onomatopœia) is simply a
<!-- Leaf 391, Page: 375 -->

On the march, too, the Laotian elephants seem to
me inferior to their fellows of India. The leaders
do barely two miles an hour over good ground.
This slow-, regular and almost mathematical pace,
however, permits very precise operations with the
compass, but otherwise is very tiresome. One ends,
however, by getting used to the aoudah and by
taking it for better or worse. Imagine a harness
of the heaviest materials and the roughest
workmanship, resting directly on the animal's back, and
kept in place by a palm-tree thong. In front is
a strap passing across the breast, and behind a rather
loose crupper made of a stick held by two cords.
Upon the harness rises a small plated bamboo chest,
largest at the top and covered by a sort of large
straw rug. The baggage is put into this chest. For
travellers it is covered with a bamboo plant, and a
railing or projection behind allows one to stow away
one's bag, trappings, gun, &c. The legs are crossed or
they hang down in front; or more often one lies
down in the shape of a Z.


In front the driver, with his feet passed through a
thong in place of stirrups, drives the beast, guiding
him with his legs. He rarely speaks to him, and I
have never seen him use the prod which he holds in
his hand. He seldom descends from his perch during
the day, and in crossing a river he lets down with a
string a small bamboo tube which he pulls up to
drink.


AVe stop as little as possible, carrying some
provisions in our aoudahs and eating on the way. The
stages are long, for we start at six o'clock in the
morning and stop only towards five o'clock.

our future in Asia.

At Kosichang I may regard my journey as finished.
After having been received by the king, I embark on
one of the AVindsor Company's steamers, which takes
us in three days to Singapore, where we once more
embark upon one of the excellent packets of the
Messageries Maritimes.


Before returning to France I desire to take a last
look behind me, to add a few words about this superb
Indo-Chinese colony of ours of which we know so
little. In the first chapters of this narrative I have
tried to show what future is reserved for us by the
opening up of the agricultural and mining resources

attack. I can say in my reply that I have been
twice into the country; I have. had my eyes about
me, I have conversed with civilians, soldiers and
colonists, and I have been thoroughly sincere;
so that in bringing before the world the outcome
of my inquiries and observations, I have, to the
best of my belief, worked towards the
advancement of the cause which has been and ever will be
my sole aim, whatever difficulties may be thrown
in my way : viz., the greatness of my country.

of Yunnam. It would seem as if nature had chosen
this province in which to fashion, as in a crucible, the
miueral products with which it has endowed the
old continent. From the ruby mines of Tengyueh,
where the Chinese used to send ruined mandarins
who were still in favour to fill their pockets, from
the copper mountains which astonished Gamier, to
the immense coal fields over which we passed when
descending to the capital, and to the inexhaustible
stores of tin of which Dr. Pichon has recently told us,
after Rocher, after Dupuis, everywhere are to be
found fresh beds and strata, each richer than the
other.


\"The markets of the East," said the Times,
speaking of this portion of China, " are the markets
of the future."


And in this the Times only echoed the opinion of
the English Chamber of Commerce.


But here arises a new question to which it is
worth our while to reply.


What are the routes which the English favour in
rivalry to the French roads of penetration into
China ?


How far should we pay any attention to these rival
routes f


There are, in the direction of the outlets which we
are considering three other routes besides that of the
Red River: the Yangtze route; that of Burmah and
the Shan States, the latter directly open toTEngland;
and the Canton, or Pakoi, route by way of Paisee.


The Yangtze Route.—It was opened to English
commerce by the supplementary article of the
Convention of Che-Fou on March 31st, 1890, according
<!-- Leaf 21, Page: 5 -->
steamers carry as many as two or three thousand
of them.


The voyage is very interesting. On leaving
HongKong and doubling the Island of Lantao, the steamer
enters the estuary formed by the Canton River, one
of the mouths of the Sikiang, or Western River.
After steaming on for a few hours the gulf gets
narrower, and we enter the pass of Bocca Tigris,
which became famous in the war of 1861. The
elevations which overhang the river upon each side
are crowned with small Chinese forts, and as we get
further up the river this line of heights gives way to
flat land very highly cultivated, notably with
ricefields and here and there with clusters of fruit trees.


The scenery, as in all regions where rice-fields
abound, is terribly monotonous, and that must be a
very strange sight indeed which can attract one's
attention. And this we see in the shape of what
looks at first like some enormous creeping yellow
vermin engendered by the mud, but which, when seen
at closer quarters, turns out to be a huge flock of
canaries which has been brought out to feed. There
is a great trade done in them here, and the flat
boats that go up and down these canals carry as
many as ten thousand. The boatmen, transformed
into bird-shepherds, let their charges out to feed in
the daytime and call them in at night by blowing
a horn.

• A little way further on"we pass a Chinese Naval
School. A visit is afffricipated from a mandarin on a
tour of inspection, and the gunboats, manned by
smart-looking crews in European dress, are be-flagged,
wdiile the pupils in full dress, which consists of a
<!-- Leaf 439, Page: 423 -->

An inquiry as to whether the construction of a
railway line on the left bank of the river is feasible.1  
  
  
  Diminution of the duties on transport goods.


An arrangement ivith the Chinese Government
permitting the export of salt.


Abolition or lowering of the entrance duties on
opium.


Creation of an establishment of industrial and
commercial credit, a sort of sous-comptoir, affiliated,
to the Bank of Indo-China, but capable of
undertaking those affairs ivhich, the statutes of the latter
forbid it to enter upon.


Once these measures for the development of the
trade of Tonkin are taken, the colony will obtain
what all our colonies lack—credit.


Still unpopular with many people, they suffer from
not being looked at in the same light all round.
And almost everywhere there exists a latent
antagonism, if indeed it is not overt, between the
colonist and the Government.


\"It is useless to help the French merchant," says
the official, " he has no money."  
  
  
  And the latter replies :—


\"Why seek capital when all sorts of obstructions
are put in one's way ? "  
  
  
  Thus they revolve in a never-ceasing vicious circle,


1 Since the conquest of Upper Burmah in 1886, up to 1891, the
English have spent there 2,830,000 rupees on railway lines.
They have carried the line which borders the Irawaddy (a
metre line of 220 miles up to Mandalay. During the year 1890
the Burmah railways, in the revenue of which the Mandalay
branch counts as two-fifths, paid a dividend of 4£ per cent.
We are far from having even tried to obtain similar results in
Tonkin.
<!-- Leaf 349, Page: 333 -->
by the foot of Buddha when he traversed the Mekong.
This is why it is called Pra bate 1 (foot of God).


Above the market and built against the hillis the
residence of one of the four leading bonzes from whom we
had a visit yesterday; and upon going to see him there
we find that the interior is ornamented with coloured
designs and pictures, given him by Frenchmen, of the
Eiffel Tower and so forth, with a small chapel in one
corner and a library of religious books, many of which
are rolled up in palm leaves. The only curious
object in the adjoining pagoda is a wooden statue of
Buddha (Pasine), in a crouching attitude, like that of
a monkey when scratching his chin. The skull is very
depressed and misshapen; and it is possible that those
who offered the image were desirous of depicting the
incident in his life, when having complained to God
of the temptation which the flesh evoked in him, he
received by way of reply a violent blow on the head
in order to crush his carnal appetites.


Among the other pagodas are Ouate Tiomsi, which
contains nothing remarkable, and Ouate Pahope, with
a good deal of wood carving and frescoes representing
animals and scenes in the life of Buddha, to say
nothing of pictures of Frenchwomen in the dress of the
First Empire, which may possibly have been brought
here by the traveller Monhot some forty years ago.
Beyond these are Ouate Paphay and Ouate Pakay,
both of which are very graceful and have beautifully
carved facades. The whole effect reminds me in a
remote measure of the Hindoo architecture, and
amono- the figures on the wood-carving of the doors is

for those of ordinary mortals.

is gained by a narrow path. In the case of other
graves there is neither a roof nor any sort of offering,
but around the raised mound of earth there is a circle
of straight stones, none more than sixteen inches long,
except those placed lengthways at the two ends, these
being often as much as forty inches. They remind me
of the Druidic monuments in Brittany; and in Central
Asia also stones are much used in the cemeteries.
The idea of raising up stones in honour of the dead
suggests itself, moreover, very naturally to the mind
without drawing from it any conclusion as to a
similarity of usage among different races. In this
instance, perhaps, the palisades and roofs belong only
to the chiefs, or are intended to mark the difference
of creeds, unless indeed it is a mere matter of hazard;
this being a question which I must leave to more
competent travellers than myself to determine.  
  
  
  February 5th.


After a night of wind and rain, we make a start
in gloomy weather, which clears up as the clay
advances, and at twelve o'clock the thermometer
stands at 68° F.


We meet some canoes conveying- a lieutenant, a
sergeant, and about forty linhs, who are in search of
pirates that had attacked the last convoy of boats.
The officer has disguised his men as uhaques, or
peasants, in order to surprise the enemy, and we
wish them good luck as we pass.


The river opens out and the hills melt into the
plain, to our right being accumulations of stones and
pebbles, while in front is a lofty plain, the bank
<!-- Leaf 148, Page: 132 -->
formphotographed between two of his wives, who are fat,
pasty-faced women, dressed in long brown tunics,
with embroidered skirts and belts and white
handkerchiefs on their heads. The Dedoc, after
havingmade us a military salute, takes his place between his
two wives, with his arms close to his side, his two
hands open; and a pleased expression on his face.
His villa is only slightly raised above the level of the
soil, instead of being on piles, while in the courtyard
we notice a curious wooden dovecote.


We halt a few miles further up the next day, upon
the same bank of the river, at the village of Ben-Mo,
not far from which place, at Su-Yut, are to be seen
veins of coal along the sides of a rivulet. It appears
to be hard and of indifferent quality, but in order
to form an opinion as to the value of the strata we
should have to make excavations for which we cannot
spare the time.


In the villages we pass through the women are busy
cooking cakes for the fetes which succeed the " Tet,"
and on the palisades are hung very fine swoop nets, the
lower ends of which are studded with leaden tresses,
&c, bound to each other. Ln front of the dwellings
are squares of woven bamboos, attached to the ends
of poles and intended to drive away the evil spirits,
and these we come across everywhere, though some of
the chiefs use instead an ordinary triangle.


In the course of the day we come to a small rapid
formed by the accumulation of stones, and the
boatmen jump into the water and push each canoe through,
while further on our canoes are hauled along by a
rope, or rather by a trolly about 100 feet long. We
then halt at Ngoe-Tro, the starting point of a. road
<!-- Leaf 322, Page: 306 -->
to be fighting the battle of liberty, the term forced
labour is substituted for slavery, because it sounds
better. I do not wish to criticise the generous
sentiments which humanitarian ideas have evoked against
slavery, but I am inclined to ask myself whether,
taking everything into account, this condition is not
often preferable for the people of the inferior races to
liberty without the means of livelihood.


I was talking with a young slave who had been
purchased by the mother-in-law of one of our
interpreters, and he did not seem at all desirous of being
freed. His parents, too poor to support him, had
sold him, he was well-fed and happy with his masters,
and asked for nothing better.


Compared to the Kas, the Laotians, as I have said,
represent the dominant race. Taller than the former,
and of a lighter complexion, the men have not in the
shoulders and chest the purity of lines which one
sees in the savages, and they generally go about
bareheaded, with their hair cut close and clothed only in a
tunic. The women wear merely a small petticoat,
though some of them have a scarf of red or yellow
silk over their breasts. Their bust is, as a rule, of
good shape, and their hair, combed back, is worn in a
small chignon. Despite their slightly flattened nose
and the size of their mouth, some of the young girls
strike one as pretty, but, as is always the case in the
south and in the east, they soon show signs of age.
They are very fond of jewellery, and generally wear
earrings in the shape of a long nail of red gold, and
bracelets of the same material.


The Laotians of Luang Prabang, in their way of
speaking and general demeanour, give me the idea of
<!-- Leaf 284, Page: 268 -->

Fishing is one of the principal resources of the
inhabitants of the valley of Nam Ou; they are forced
to turn everything into money, for they are crushed
by the taxes imposed upon them by Siam. The
village, on the right bank, in which we spend the
night, is inhabited by some people from Traniuh,
who tell us that they left their homes three years ago
on account of the cholera, they came to Luang
Prabang in five nights, and from there they have
come up here; but they do not appear to have gained
any advantage from their change of place; they have
fled from the frying-pan into the fire, for their new
conquerors make each man pay eight rupees a year
poll tax; they can remember a time before these
heavy burdens were laid upon them, but now they
can never satisfy the revenue collectors. A great
many of them are forced to sell all their possessions.
At first they refuse to let us have any provisions, and
as we are now without food I am reduced to extreme
measures. The villagers assert that they have neither
fowls nor eggs in the place.


"If you do not rear poultry," I reply, "we may
consider that all we find are wild birds," and I
tell the interpreter to open a hen-house and take
out two chickens, offering fifteen pence for them,
which is, of course, accepted. AVhen the owners have
once examined the coins, sounded them and found
them good, they regain confidence and bring us some
eggs. Their distrust arises from the proceedings of
the Siamese soldiers, who, as they travel, requisition
everything they require without any payment; the
villagers thought that we might do the same, but now
they realize that we are honest people.
<!-- Leaf 237, Page: 221 -->
spread all over the globe, with English words always
sounding in their ears, since it is universally admitted
that they do not understand any other idiom !


In the evening we commence the descent into an
immense valley, which opens before us like an abyss
of which the bottom remains unknown, veiled by the
mists. AVe stop in the midst of the woods at the
village of Sa-ko-san (literally, San mountain of Sako,
Cardamom).


AVe are still amongst the Yaos; the women are
occupied in dying stuffs in tunnels dug in the earth
and filled with indigo. Upon a terrace, overlooking
the valley, seven posts, four or five yards high,
terminated by seven circles, like certain monuments in
Thibet, support some planks on a platform. I am told
that once a year the people come and play music on
these scaffolds in honour of the spirits.


Here the natives seem a good deal preoccupied with
religious beliefs. In the house where we passed the
night an old man is busy praying, and we are careful
not to disturb him. Seated upon a stool, he recites
his prayers before a small piece of furniture which
serves as an altar, and while he speaks he gets rid of
some small sheets of white paper which he holds in his
hand, and pretends to read, he then burns them, rises
and recites some litanies, while with one hand he
shakes a stick terminated by some rings, which clash
together, with the other he takes a cup of water,
carries it to his mouth and spits upon the altar; then
squatting clown again, he sounds his rings, throws some
water about with the point of his stick, and ends by
pouring out the rest: he finishes the ceremony by
burning some more paper. Five cups containing

does not do more than a quarter of the work of a
European, the cost of labour is as high as it is in
France. The Annamite gangers get about a shilling
Ooo ~
per day of ten hours. There is some work done at
night, but Sunday is a day of rest. Upon the day of
our visit 160 tons had been extracted, but the
average is about ten tons less. When I add that the
total production of Nagotna alone is estimated at 40
million tons, it will be seen that there is plenty of
work still in hand. Upon the following day we went
to see Hatou. The railway, ten miles in length,
which, as I have already said, is being constructed,
will not'be finished for six months. In order to
reach the mine, we go first in a steam launch through
the bay of Fitz-along, and thence in a canoe, which
in some places has to be pushed through the water,
the last part of the journey being in a small cart
drawn by buffaloes. The country is a very
picturesque one, for we are in the brush, and beyond
are hills the summits of which are covered with
forests which have so far escaped being burnt.


These forests are peopled with game of all kinds:
deer, wild boar, bears and tigers, and there is a fine
field here for the naturalist as well as the sportsman;
the fauna of the Bay of Halong is a very
interestingsubject of study. I am told that in certain islets
there are rock antelopes of the nemorhadus species,
such as M. Bonvalot and myself came across during
our travels in Thibet, In the island of Cae-Ba there
are, as I am assured, large monkeys with a tuft of
hair upon their heads, which make them look like
clowns. The mouths of the rivers and the small
sandy creeks are the resort of enormous tortoises,
<!-- Leaf 35, Page: 19 -->
about 18 feet draught of water being able to go up
the Cua-Cam at all tides, while five times a month, at
the moment of the highest tides, it is accessible to
ships of 25 feet draught. Even the former are often
obliged to wait several hours in front of Doson for
high tide before going up stream, and as
nothinghas been done to prevent the sand from accumulating
at the bar, the draught of water is still decreasing.
In view of this ever-increasing obstacle in the way of
the large vessels, the question has been raised of
creating a port elsewhere upon the coast. Quang-Yen,
at the mouth of the Song-Gia, would be of little
service, as it has but an inch or so more water than
Haiphong, and a better one might be found in one of
the magnificent harbours formed by the rocks in the
bay of Halong. That of Hong-Hay, which faces the
coal-fields of that name, is wTell situated, but access to
it is still rather difficult, the depth of water being in
many cases not more than from 16 to 20 feet, and it
would seem that the shelter of K^bao is preferable,
with a depth of 23 feet at the foot of the cliffs, at
low water. Moreover, coal is to be found on the
spot, and the harbour, half closed in by several islands,
would have the advantage of being more easily
defended in the event of war.


Whatever site may be selected, I do not think that
the creation of a large port on the coast would be
immediately ruinous to the future of Haiphong, for
the town would always remain a centre for the rice
trade, and for the disposal of various native products,
and for the river traffic of passengers and goods. Its
position at the foot of the intersection of several canals
makes it at once a centre and a terminus for fluvial  
  
  
  C 2
<!-- Leaf 374, Page: 358 -->
in the neighbourhood of Kiangsen, there is a ruby
mine belonging to the king of Nan, which is not yet
worked, though a Burmese has applied for a
concession. But though the natural products of Luang
Prabang arc so varied, the cost of transport over so
long a distance from the coast would reduce the profits
very considerably, though I think that the complaints
of the Chinese traders as to business being carried on
at a loss must be an exaggeration, for if so why do
they carry it on %


In any event, it is difficult to form a precise
estimate of the commerce of the principality. According
to the Siamese the exports from the Laos region,
which includes the country between Strung Treng and
Xiangsen in one direction, and Xieng Mai and Attopen
in the other, amount to about £900,000, and if this
estimate is correct the proportion of Luang Prabang
must be very small. Macey gives the exports of
benzoin at £40,000, but if this was so at one time the
total must have decreased very much.


But trifling as the commercial movement of Luang
Prabang may be, it is of interest to us, because of the
situation of the town upon the Mekong, nearly in the
centre of the Laos and in the vicinity of Tonkin, to
see what share we may hope to have in it and what
profit can be derived from it. Opinions vary very
much upon the subject, and Mr. Archer, the British
Consul, whose statistical reports as to the trade of this
region are well worth careful study, is of opinion that
there is little to fear from French competition, the
cost of transport being too great, and with regard to
steam navigation, he does not deem it possible upon
the Mekong, on account of the rapids upon the other
<!-- Leaf 61, Page: 45 -->
not but be of service, and, with resources of all kinds
abundant, all that is wanted is to make a good use of
them.


We spent several hours at Kebao, and from what
little I was able to see and hear, I believe that it is
an enterprise well commenced, which is destined to
yield good results.


It is not so far advanced as Hong-Hay, but the
concession is of the same extent; the coal seems to
be of much the same kind, but if at the present time
there is perhaps rather less dust at Kebao than at
Hong-Hay, the quality seems to be rather inferior,
there being more schist in it. The two enterprises
have each their system for the delivery of coal, for
while Hong-Hay will send its coal to Hong-Kong on
vessels loaded at its quays, the Kebao coal will rather
be sent in barges to Haiphong, where vessels will
take it over for burning and for freight. Some of the
coal, however, is sold to go to Canton and Siam, and
a contract has been signed with an English firm in
Siam to supply them with 30,000 tons a year. Kebao
coal is selling for fivepence a ton less than
HongHay, and the navy, it may be added, uses both. It
would be imprudent to offer an opinion as to the
future of the two workings, all that I can say being
that that at Hong-Hay has been carried out upon a
larger scale and a bigger capital than that of Kebao,
but I do not think that they are destined to become
rivals; there is room, and to spare, for all. Far from
being in each other's way, they ought to be of mutual
help, and thus their joint efforts and prosperity,
while enriching Tonkin, will contribute in no small
measure to bring about a complete change of opinion
<!-- Leaf 247, Page: 231 -->
the cost of transport is still too great for them to be
worked at much profit, and yet a great deal might be
done with them. Copper is plentiful; beds of it are
known to exist upon the right bank of the Black River,
a few hours above the mouth of the Nam-Ma. Some
specimens that I have seen appeared to me very rich and
infinitely superior to those of the Deloustal mine. A
native at Lai brought me a piece of almost pure copper
ore that came from Tafine, and which probably weighs
about thirty pounds. Five silver mines are known.
Lead is very frequently found, and the pirates extract
a sufficient quantity for the manufacture of their bullets.
The mines in the upper part of the Black River have
never been much worked, for at first the labourers were
too heavily oppressed, and now the pirates are dreaded.


To this dangerous work and their uncertain profits,
the people prefer agriculture, navigation (nearly all the
inhabitants of Lai are boatmen), and commerce.
Every winter a caravan of from one to two hundred
mules arrives from China; they remain until the
spring, separating into groups of two, three, or four.
to go from village to village, to right or to left. The
Chinese sell iron, sugar, oil, stoves, saucepans,
vermicelli, opium, &c.; they buy, chiefly, stags' antlers,
medical ingredients, and cotton. Formerly the
province of Laichau annually produced from four
to five hundred piculs of cotton, now the amount
has diminished to one hundred. According to Deo
Van Tri this reduction is due to the competition at
Mongtze of the spun cottons that come from
ChangHay or Pakoi.


I shall not dwell now upon the commercial situation
of Laichau or upon the possible traffic up the Black
<!-- Leaf 87, Page: 71 -->
of the contract, another third upon the shipping of
the materials, a sixth four months after they had
been set up in Hanoi, and the remainder two years
afterwards.


Our own contractors, who are such slaves to
routine, cannot therefore be astonished if the
colonists go elsewhere for what they require in the way
of machinery, but one can scarcely blame workmen for
not caring to face the long voyage to Tonkin,
especially as they have been prejudiced against it
by people who do not scruple to sacrifice the
interests of their country to those of politics, the
mistrust which has been thus created being one which
it will take a long time to get over. Three times in
succession M. Bourgoing-Meiffre went to Nimes to
try and get five women to come out and spin the
silk at Hanoi, but though he offered them very high
wages and they promised to come, he had no sooner
turned his back than-they were induced by ignorant
friends and neighbours to break their word. Despite
all these difficulties, M. Bourgoing-Meiffre has given
a fresh impetus to his silk factory, and he is now
preparing to start a cotton factory, while he has also
started large tea plantations, which are under the
charge of five skilled men whom he has brought
over from Ceylon.


{empty}M. Daurelle also cultivates silk; while the firm of
Pila is about to open three manufactories with 600
looms. Then there are dressmaking establishments
under the management of M. Charpentier, and others
for the making of ice, beer, &c, while steamboats
and sloops are built on the slips at Haiphong.
<!-- Leaf 29, Page: 13 -->
coal burnt in their respective furnaces : very black
smoke being produced by the Japan coal; gray
smoke by the Japan coal mixed with that of
HongHay, and no smoke at all by pure Hong-Hay
alone.


Before going into the refinery we are reminded
that it is in full activity, so that it is not at
experiments that we are assisting, but ve
see it fully employed in a regular way. The
boilers are fed by twelve furnaces, the three first
of which burn a mixture in equal proportions of
Japanese and Hong-Hay coal dust. The latter,
we are told, if used alone, would pass through the
bars of the grate and would be too expensive, but
used in this way, the two combustibles agglomerate
and form lumps as big as one's fist, the bits which
pass between the bars being very few, and besides they
are burnt a second time. The mixture of the two
dusts, Mr. Chater tells us, effects a saving, while
obtaining the same pressure, of 15 or 20 per cent, on
the pure Japan coal. There is less of it, and it emits
a long white flame.


The next group of furnaces burn Hong-Hay
coal, part of which was extracted eight months ago,
and the rest quite recently, the whole of it coming
from Nagotna (in Hong-Hay), and the greatest
depth from which it was taken being sixty-five
feet. The lumps are generally of a good size
and lustrous, dirtying the hand when touched, and
analysis has shown that they contain about 8 or
9 per cent, of volatile matter and 90 per cent, of
carbon.

The chiefs receive us as kindly as usual, and I take
advantage of their good-will and of the light to take
some portraits. The women sit well. One of them
is celebrated here and is considered a great beauty;
her pale complexion, curved nose, thick lips and large
black eyes remind me of the Jewish type. As to the
coolies, they are frightened, and, like those in Thibet,
implore me on their knees not to photograph them.
Before I can induce them to sit for me, I am obliged
to open my apparatus and show them that it does not
contain anything dangerous. In the evening we
perform on the ariston organ, and our hosts greatly
appreciate the music. AVe offer them some knives and
pictures, and in their turn they bring us some
manuscript books of songs. I had two of them translated
at Luang Prabang. In spite of the naive character of
the subjects and of the comparisons used, I think it
will be interesting to quote them here, and I have
endeavoured to reproduce as faithfully as possible
the simple version given by the interpreter.


\"A man and a woman are much in love with each
other. But the girl's father and mother will not give
her to the young man but upon one condition; he
must adopt the trade of weaver and learn to work,
the girl shall then be given to him in marriage.


\"The lover says farewell to his future parents-in-law
in order to go and trade at Moung Noc-Fa; he earns
thirty horses and thirty buffaloes, which he takes to
Muong Ho for sale there, After making a profit of

her parents, the young girl is promised to another.

Nona, Our interpreter takes us into the deepest
part, and the water comes up to our knees, but
fortunately the sun is powerful, and will quickly repair
the mischief.


AVe halt at three o'clock in the afternoon and the
coolies refuse to go any further; they say that we
should not find any water, and that there is a high
mountain in front of us which cannot be crossed
before nightfall. AVe have no choice but to listen to
our men's advice and to resign ourselves to stopping
here. Shelters are erected side by side, facing the
streams, like the booths at a fair, a polygon of
crossed strips of bamboo is fastened to a post to drive
away the spirits and large fires are lighted; at the
risk of being roasted we draw near to them and
smoke ourselves to escape the wasps, which prey upon
the refuse left by the passage of other caravans.


The coolies cook their dinner in bamboo tubes with
some water at the bottom, a horn formed of laurel
leaves above it holds the rice, this is the sole
apparatus. In other saucepans of the same kind some
banana buds are boiling, and some pieces of pig's
skin are roasting upon sticks. AVhen dinner is ready
a strip of bamboo is peeled lengthwise from one knot
to the next and forms an improvised bowl in which
the meat is served. A handful of salt which we give
the men is received as a great delicacy, for salt is rare
and very dear here.


I take a turn with my gun before nightfall; but the
jungle is so thick that I can scarcely advance. I see
traces of some large animals which recall the
<!-- Leaf 270, Page: 254 -->
excrelonging to hear the news that he reads aloud to us,
our hearts beat in sympathy as our thoughts fly far
from Theng, to some corner of the beautiful land of
France.


Before we leave the effective force loses a member,
one of the Muong sharpshooters dies of rheumatism
of the heart; the body is placed in a coffin, which is
carried to a grave dug at the foot of a hillock; one of
the men takes the branch of a tree and turns towards
the tomb with the gesture that we make in sprinkling
the holy water; the father of the deceased then puts
a little earth upon the coffin, and the other mourners
follow his example, the grave is then closed; in two
years it will be re-opened and the bier will be taken
out and carried back to the dead man's native village;
sometimes the people use cremation; but the
sharpshooters rarely die at the post; if they are ill and
think they are in any danger they ask to be taken
back to their own villages, to pray there with special
ceremonies (tchimtchimbouddah), but they frequently
die on the way.  
  
  
  March 2'ird.


Our coolies arrive late, so we content ourselves
with going to the other side of the plain to sleep at
the village of Ban-Loun. M. Gassouin accompanies
us as far as the Nam-Kom, which we cross by a ford.
A little before we reach the river we pass through a
rectangular space, two hundred yards wide, by about
four hundred long. Its measurements are marked
by fragments of walls, for it is the old Chinese fort,
in the midst of which the French post was first
established; but here it had the disadvantage of being
<!-- Leaf 244, Page: 228 -->
Aran Tri, who is there at the present time, but they
will come back on the following day, March 11th. One
of them is M. Massie, apothecary major to the army,
a former member of the Pavie Mission. For the last
five years he has been in Laos and the surrounding
districts as agent for France at Luang Prabang; he is
returning from a tour in the Sibsompannas; the second
is M. Gassouin, a lieutenant now commanding the
post of Dien Bien Fou. Both of them advise me
not to go to Xienhoung. It is now the middle of
March and the mules have not yet arrived, so that we
could not reach Xienhoung before the end of April,
and then we should just encounter the rainy season
for our return through Burmah.


{empty}M. Massie invites me to go with him by Tali-Fou
(there is one road which, from Lai, will take us there
in about fifty days), and from thence (if we once get
to that city) we can try to reach Kin-Cha-Kiang. I
own that the idea is very attractive, and the enterprise
would be delightful, but unfortunately we are not in
any way equipped for such an expedition, and we
have not the necessary time to spare; another thing,
if I enter China I must give up seeing Laos, that is
to say, abandon one of the objects of my journey.
After much discussion, and consideration, we resign
ourselves to going, by Dien Bien Fou, to Luang
Prabang, where M. Massie will precede us, and
a Cambodian interpreter will be sent on before
us. I am not sorry to get rid of lazy Cho-Ken
so quickly, for his information, when he gives us
any, is very defective, His former master, Deo
Van Tri, when hearing us speak of him, shook
his head, laughing, " Cho-Ken is not good. I sent
<!-- Leaf 440, Page: 424 -->
simply because of the primary misunderstanding as
to the real ends of colonisation.


This state of things from which we all suffer is not
innate in the French character. AA7e are colonisers,
and to those who may be inclined to smile I would
simply point, to take only one instance, to Canada.
But it is an accident due to a confusion. It is for us
to break through the circle of routine prejudice,
distrust and chicane within which we are inclosed.


\"You have eyes," said MacCarthy to his
compatriots, "open them. Look a little beyond your
own neighbourhood, your club, your set, your
village."


Look Eastward, I would add. I do not know what
Africa may be worth, for I have never been there.
I feel sure it includes some regions that are very
rich, and I would fain believe that the millions spent
on the Congo will one day be restored to us and that
Dahomey oils will enrich our merchants. I have the
profoundest admiration for all the long list of bold
explorers, the Mizons, the Bingers, the Monteils, the
Maistres, the Dybowskys, &c, who, with the French
flag in their hands, have covered half of Africa with
a network of tricoloured lines.


To possess the energy and daring to undertake
labours so perilous faith is needful above all else, as
was said, some months ago by one of the most
fervent believers in the future of Tonkin.1 Faith in
the greatness of the Dark Continent, they have it all
of them, but how far they can justify it I cannot
venture to say.  
  
  
  But I do know what Asia is, not merely as regards

and restore their former splendour... or until
some vandal traveller, some Karl Boch, transports
their heads to the west, whilst their bodies remain
upon their native soil.


Further on, and nearer Theng, one hillock is
covered with fragments of walls, the remains of
Siamese fortifications. Opposite to them the French
flag waves in the midst of our most distant post on
the north-west frontier of Tonkin. Some five or
six years ago it was occupied by Colonel Pennequin
at the head of a company; the plain of Theng was
then overrun by Siamese troops. They prudently
retired before us, their chief urging as a reason for
his coming the wush to prepare some boats for
{empty}M. Pavie, and to provide an escort for him. At first
we established ourselves a few miles lower down in the
plain, in the middle of an ancient fortress. It Avas
good policy to remove us to our present position on
the highest point, from which we can overlook the
plain. Fifty men commanded by Lieutenant Gassouin
and two non-commissioned officers of the marines
form the garrison; it is lodged in two or more huts
built upon piles and one brick building, surrounded
by a palisade, in the centre of which a reduit has
been constructed of thick bamboos, placed close
together and pierced with loopholes; the rifles are
kept in this blockhouse, which is constantly watched,
and where the garrison could take refuge in case of
an attack.


A tree is growing in the inclosure. The
inhabitants consider it sacred, and every one is obliged
to respect it for fear of wounding their religious
susceptibilities.
<!-- Leaf 141, Page: 125 -->
affair of a few minutes; but we are, alas ! the objects
of an illusion.


However, we get down at last, and the aged native
at whose place we quench our thirst, having fulfilled
the duties of hospitality, returns to the occupation
from which we had diverted him. AVith much
kneeling, accompanied by prayers, he renders homage
to the manes of his ancestors, to whom he has offered
small presents, small pieces of perfumed wood, milk,
quids of betel, fruits and dainties.


We cannot leave Cho-Bo, where we arrived for
dinner last night, for two clays; and although this
delay is vexing, we must resign ourselves to it. The
30th is the Tesson, the first day of the Annamite
year; and it is useless even to think of doing
anything with the natives during this feast. Women,
soldiers, merchants, boys, every one is up, and from
dawn the noise begins; the air is infected by the
never-ceasing fireworks; for a few sapeques our boys
buy themselves chaplets of Chinese crackers that
they bring and burn before our door, thinking no
doubt they are honouring us greatly; the garrison
are regaled by M. Vacle, who offers them a bullock,
and a jar of tchoum-tchoum (rice brandy), they eat
and drink all day, and at night they are nearly all
tipsy.


During these festivities I am looking after my
collections, killing several birds and catching some
butterflies. The small islets of the river are
teeming with otters, but though we set several snares
we do not succeed in catching any, nor are wTe
more fortunate with the porcupines up in the hills.  
  
  
  However, we are soon out of the Tet, and all that

to three magistrates selected for the purpose, but once
the distribution of the lands has been effected, the
produce is not divided, each person being left free to
enjoy the fruits of his labour. The chiefs have more
important lots given them, and they employ a part
of the population; while if they are rather hard upon
their workmen, on the other hand they possess
granaries, store up provisions and feed the
husbandmen, who, having sold their harvest too soon, find
themselves without any means of subsistence. This
system has the advantage of equalizing fortunes; it
rarely produces individual wealth, but it prevents
great distress. There is no clearly-defined religion
among the Thais of this region; further north we shall
meet with Buddhist tendencies imported from China
or Burmah; but here there is nothing formal, neither
divinities, pagodas, books nor priests. Upon the one
hand, there is the worship of ancestors, on the other a
belief in spirits, which personify the forces of nature,
disease, or, in a word, the unknown origins of tangible
phenomena. Is not this usually the case in all
primitive religions ? Whatever quarter of the globe we may
visit, shall we not see the supernatural arising from
the unknown and blending with it ? The spirits are
combated or invoked by little sticks of perfume and
offerings, by small altars raised upon four posts and
covered with red paper, by ornaments upon the houses,
triangles or squares in bamboo, and by recourse to
sorcerers. The latter exert great influence; there are
frequently two in the same place, one representing the
principle of good, the other that of evil. In this
case they must avoid meeting each other; and if, in
spite of all precautions, they find themselves face to

whole work is completed in a single day, the
housewarming taking place the same evening, and all who
have shared in the work joining in it.


It may be asked how do the Laotians spend their
time if they are lazy and have scarcely any occupation ?
The answer is easy—the greater part of their clays
and nights being employed in paying court to the
young ladies and in services at the pagoda.


Formerly there was a law dispensing the young
men from military service and taxation upon the
ground that their first duty was towards the young
women, and although this law is repealed de jure, it
still serves as a rule of conduct and reveals the spirit
of this people.


The men gossip with the girls, give them flowers,
play to them, recite verses, sing them songs and
play at cards with them, but never dance with them.
Men and women walk through the streets singing, in
groups where the two sexes are apart, or sit opposite
the one to the other at the entrance to the pagodas.
I shall have an opportunity of recurring to these
peculiar love-makings, and I have noticed that, in
contradistinction to what generally takes place in the
East, here it is the young women who dominate the
men, who go through the form of beating them, if
necessary, and who condescend to cast an amorous
glance at them or to respond to their compliments.


Some of these flirtations are durable, for a young
man who has paid court for a long time to a girl
generally ends by making her his mistress, but this
is not looked upon as at all dishonourable, for there
are a great many unmarried women mothers, and
some of them are held in as much respect as those
<!-- Leaf 65, Page: 49 -->
them, or putting their hands to their mouths as much
as to say that they are hungry. These bronzed little
creatures, naked from head to foot, with their
protuberant stomachs and thin legs, always remind me
of the gnomes and elves of fairy tales.


Half-way up the river, to the right, is a large
village, which may almost be called a town. This is
Hong-Yen, and all that we have time to see in a
quarter of an hour are a few white houses, a residence
which has been repaired and to which are attached
two tigers (in plaster) as guardians, the post-office
and an inn. The jetty has been placed against a
sand bank, and the river has been gradually eating
into the bank for many years. But nothing has been
done to arrest this process, as the Residents change
too frequently to venture upon any work of
importance, the average being about five in a year.
Fortunately the district is very quiet. From
HongYen to Hanoi, where we arrive late at night, there
is no other village of importance.


Founded in the eighth century by a Chinese
mandarin, Hanoi is officially styled Tham-lang-Tham
(the City of the Red Dragon). It is also called Kecho
(the Great Market), Bac-Thanh (Citadel of the North),
and Dong-Kink (Capital of the East).


The territory of the town itself, which has over
100.000 inhabitants, is in the shape of a triangle, two
sides of which are formed by the bank of the Red
River and by the citadel, which almost meet at right
angles.


On landing, the passenger at once finds himself
upon the Concession, as the land originally ceded to
France by the treaty of 1874 is called. In place of

pirogues are bought, the sharpshooters are paid,
and the coolies are requisitioned. The post was built
out of the fines; the grant allowed for it was twenty
piastres (£3 4s. Od.), yet more than 3,000 bamboos
had to be cut for it. M. Gassouin exerts himself to
improve the position of the inhabitants. The plain
is rich and would be very productive if vegetables
and plants were introduced; the garden belonging to
the post already produces great results, the cabbages
are superb. AAThen the district becomes more
populated the mines may be worked; iron ore is found,
and it is said that coal is not unknown.1


As to commerce it is insignificant, Theng is too
far away from other centres, but M. Gassouin hopes
to create a local market here, which all the natives of
the country-side would attend. During our visit, a
caravan of forty horses led by some Chinese encamps
at the foot of the post, it is a portion of the annual
convoy from Yunnam, which passes by Lai Chan.
The traders have sold their opium and stuffs to
the Laos, and they are bringing back some cotton
cloths, but they have not been able to sell their
iron saucepans. The lieutenant buys a piece of
calico about forty yards long, it comes from Laos
and bears both English and Chinese marks. No
matches are to be found here.


The inhabitants of Theng trade in cattle, they
have just brought twenty-three animals from Laos
(seventeen of them are bullocks), which they are
going to sell at Tuan Giao and even at Van Bou.  
  
  
  With regard to the products of the village itself,


1 I have seen some specimens of coal which M. Massie picked
up in the bed of the Nam Lai.
<!-- Leaf 251, Page: 235 -->
feet, the temperature has lowered; it is not more
than sixty degrees. Sao shivers and wraps a towel
round him for a mantle. As we descend it becomes
warmer, and as the large trees reappear at the same time,
we are once more surrounded by a tropical flora. It
seems as if the flowering trees of the summits, which
recall the species of our countries, were only
abortions, stunted specimens by the side of their brothers
in the valley. In the virgin forest we see many
beautiful birds of variegated plumage, and I bring
down a superb great horn owl, of which the men
eat the flesh.


The end of this stage is marked on the banks of
a stream by the remains of a shelter. The place is
called Sah Long, and it awakens terrible memories in
the mind of young Thou. " Yen has a great many
tigers (tit)," he tells us, as he fills his saucepans.
\"AVhen M. Macey came here a tiger killed one horse
and wounded another." AA7e can only draw nearer to
each other. Some huts are quickly constructed of
bamboos and banana leaves, they are open in front and face
each other, so we cook in the middle of them, eat as we
sit round the fire, and go to bed early. In spite of
the threatened dangers the night passes without
incident.  
  
  
  March 16th.


A good part of the day is again spent in the
midst of the woods, the road is fair and less uneven
than yesterday's; we are passing through a forest of

of a man's leg, and they rise in a single stem to a great

commercial outlet upon behalf of Tonkin, of a colony
which we took possession of in order to secure the
shortest and most direct route to the great markets
of China.


Such is the plan of my work, but, before carrying
it into execution, I cannot but ask myself whether, in
doing so, I shall not make enemies all round.


If I address myself to the people in Tonkin, I
shall in some cases not be sufficiently well posted; in
others, I shall not say enough; in others, again, too
much. In addressing myself to people at home, I
shall be boring them with details which scarcely
interest them, with names hard to pronounce, and with
very arid topics. So the best thing I can do is to ask
each individual reader to think that I am writing for
the other, and to assure them that I am addressing
myself to every true-hearted Frenchman; in a wrord,
to all those whose one desire is to labour for the
greatness of their fatherland.
<!-- Leaf 427, Page: 411 -->

From Lai to Stemao is eighteen days, and from
Stemao to Xienghoung eight days.


From Lai to Tali by two good roads, much
frequented by the caravans, is from twenty-eight to
thirty days, that is to say :  
  
  
  From Haiphong to Ibang, thirty-nine daj-s;
From Haiphong to Stemao, thirty-nine days;
From Haiphong to Xienghoung, forty-seven clays;
From Haiphong to Tali, fifty clays.


Coming down the Black River, the voyage would
would be less by a fortnight.


If we suppose Lao-kai reached in two days, and
the route which at present connects Laichau and
Mungtze, directly linked to Lao-kai, Haiphong would
be only ten days' journey from Laichau.


AVhether the traders from Ibang, Puerh, and
Stemao take the Black River route or that of the
Red River, it will still be on the Tonkin coast that
they will find their nearest port. It remains for us
to take advantage of this fact by providing products
for the numerous caravans which follow the trade
routes of these regions, and by inducing them in
turn to come to us.


Trade with Thibet.—Our trade connections may
also extend beyond Puerh and Stemao westward to
TaliFou and Upper Burmah. The Thibetans annually
descend to Tali for the great fair ofthe third quarter moon,
and they then push on as far as Puerh to buy tea.
AVould not this be an opportunity for us to exchange
some of our products for theirs ? We might give
them rice, blue and white Canton cloth, cotton, spun

seized with a wasting illness, and we frequently went
to see him. One of the interpreters of the Consulate
was teaching his pupils French, and they struck me
as being very intelligent, while their lessons wrere
well done.


AVe also made the acquaintance of the Siamese
colonel and of the commandant. The former, attired
in a small white jacket, blue silk trousers, helmet,
stockings and shoes, is a man of considerable
intelligence, and very pleasant in his manner. The
Prah Pa La Sa Da (abbreviated into Prah Sad a), or
chief over a thousand, has been decorated by the
French Government at the request of M. Pavie, to
whom he often refers, and he is of great use to us
during our stay, especially in respect to the
photography, in which he is himself an expert.


We receive visits from- the brothers of the kings
who send to say that they will be very pleased to
see us, and, in order to reach their residence, we
have to cross the river. There is much to note of
interest on the way, and many good subjects for a
photograph.


AVe notice, for instance, on the sand-banks near
the water, rows of poles, which women, with baskets
passed through their arms, come to inspect, and
apparently to wipe at frequent intervals. This
excites our curiosity, and when we get closer, we find
that these poles are clone over w-ith glue to catch the
grasshoppers which alight upon them, and which are
sold in the market as a staple article of food. A
good deal of net fishing goes on in the river itself,
but it is not till later in the season that the prabeuc,
a fish resembling the sturgeon, is caught. At fixed

is out of his nurse's arms. We had not been masters
of Tonkin for two years before we surrounded it with
a thick wall of custom dues, and in order to gratify a
few French traders we arrested the commercial
development of the colony, not reflecting that a budding
colony needs the maximum of liberty and free action,
that the greater the imports and exports the greater
the profit, The main thing is to encourage capital to
come in and for machinery to be set up, to open up
a path to commerce and to make it as plain and clear
as possible. This is what has been overlooked, though
it ought to have been foreseen that prohibitory
measures would disgust the Chinese, who have
preferred to stick to the longer route by the Yang-Tse,
or by the Canton river. It is, moreover, the custom
dues and certain monopolies that encourage smuggling,
and smuggling is but a step from piracy. These
considerations, among many, no doubt escaped the notice
of our legislators when they applied the custom duties
to our colonies, and some of them went so far as to
reproach the Under Secretary of State for having
exempted from duty the English machinery purchased
for the Hong-Hay coal fields. It was to be regretted,
no doubt, that the material was not French, but I am
inclined to doubt, after all I have seen, whether our
manufactories could provide what was wanted with
the same rapidity and at the same price. But who is
to blame for that, and would it be fair not to give a
free hand to a large and growing enterprise which is
probably destined to cast further lustre and add fresh
wealth to the colony ?


It is not my intention to echo all the recriminations
which the establishment of custom duties has
<!-- Leaf 165, Page: 149 -->
proseveral trips. For the assistance which he rendered
in saving these guns the old Chinaman was given a
medal, of which he is naturally very proud.

We do not find much to buy here, excepting the
nail of a rhinoceros, which, as we are told, comes from
the neighbourhood and is a remedy against headaches.
Our men purchase sugar-cane, bamboos, salad, fowls
(a franc each) and a very large pig, which costs nearly
a sovereign, or about a third less than at Hanoi,
according to Thou. Payment is effected in fragments
of piastres weighed in Chinese scales.


All these matters being settled, we enter upon a
fresh stage, but as our men want the afternoon to
kill the pig and make merry over it, and as we are
well in advance of time, we do not go far, being all
the more inclined to meet their wishes in that they
are very handy and willing, so that we are on the
best of terms together. No sooner have we reached
our destination than the boats are made fast, the
wood picked up, the fires lighted and the kettle put on
before our lazy cook has got out of his berth. The
scene to-day is a most typical one, and a more graphic
pen than mine would be needed to describe it. In a
fewT hours the pig is killed, scalded, cut up, and put
on to cook, the boatmen, who are seated in circles
round the fires commencing the repast at daybreak
and not terminating it till nightfall. First of all
they eat the blood mixed with rice and pimento, then
the tripe cut up into small bits and seasoned with
wild tomatoes gathered in the woods, winding up
with the bacon and meat. After all this, they fetch,
with great precaution, several bamboo canes which
had been stowed away in the bottom of the boats and

where the European sailor cannot do the same amount
of work as in his own latitudes, have very properly
been exempted from the provisions of clause 2 in the
navigation act, without forfeiting their right to
navigation premiums."


I may add that the registration of our vessels at
Saigon would give us an advantage over the Germans,
who earn a dividend of from 10 to 15 per cent, upon
the capital invested, while one English firm has paid
as much as 30 per cent. All that is needed for us to do
as well is a little more initiative, the invariable reply
of our shippers and capitalists, when they are asked
to go into an enterprise in these parts, being " It is a
very long way off." Aud yet we have not hesitated
to invest a lot of money in very risky speculations
on the other side of the globe, though some of them
had nothing in their favour except that they were
puffed up to the skies. However, this is not the place
for recrimination or for re-opening a wound which has
not yet had time to heal.


The question is not what ought to have been done
or left undone, but what can be done, and it is the
duty of all travellers who return from the far east
to try to make plain what is the position which we
can and ought to hold, for there is no reason why we
should not be at least on a parity with Germany as
regards the merchant service. The enterprise, as I
would fain repeat, is at once profitable and patriotic.


The number of vessels calling at or coming from
Haiphong has, as I have said, nearly doubled in the
last year, but the foreign trade of 1891, though much
larger than that of 1890, did not reach the same
proportion, being one million and a half sterling as against
<!-- Leaf 417, Page: 401 -->
the new line, despite the rivalry of the river traffic,
already brings in more than any of the Indian
railway lines.


7s the trade here worth the efforts already
expended? Arc fresh efforts justifiable?


AArhat have we to gain by getting to Lao Kai
rapidly and cheaply I


Supposing our goods to be up from the
unloading port to Lao Kai in two days, a thing which has
already been proved possible, they would find an
immediate market. They could enter Yunnam and
Kouangsi, might even reach Setchuen and Kouitchou.
Here they would have fifty millions of possible
consumers.


To go from Lao Kai to Yunnam-Sen takes only
from thirteen to fourteen clays. The capital of
Yunnam would, therefore, be only sixteen days from
the great port of Tonkin. At present it takes from
fifty-one daj-s to one hundred, according to the route
chosen in this or that part of China.

Its position at the meeting of a number of trade
routes gives Yunnam-Sen a great importance.


The chief export articles of Yunnam which would
take the Red River route are : copper (to the extent
of more than 500 tons a year); tin (nearly 3,000
tons a year); opium, the exportable surplus of which

information, whenever they vouchsafe any, is always
incorrect. If we occasionally trust to their assurances,
we pay dearly for our confidence, as we are sure to
be overtaken by nightfall, having lost our way,
without bed or board. Assuredly lovers of the picturesque
would then be satisfied. The weather is stormy and
very dark, our way being occasionally illuminated by
the lightning. The elephants walk slowly, while the
cries of innumerable frogs produce a frightful and
constant clamour, drowned sometimes by the rolling
of the thunder. AVith the night have come the
glowworms which we keep on mistaking for the lights of a
village. AVe advance confidently, and it is only after
some minutes that we discover that we have been
the victims of an illusion. In the darkness it is
something like the mirage, a tiring, annoying,
disappointing, exasperating sensation to which we would
prefer a hundred times over a good table and a good
bed. Let me not be accused here of being too matter
of fact, for no one has a keener appreciation for
poetry. But I think, for my part, that on an empty
stomach the muse is a very slight consolation. Let
those who do not believe me try the experiment.


On April 30th, having crossed a small cultivated
plain, we reach a river 330 feet wide, which
rolls a slow and turbid current between sandy
banks. It is the Menam, the river of Siam. We
stop at the village of Ban Tahit, situated half a mile
above the more important town of Outaradit, where
we leave our elephants.


This is, practically, the end of our journey. AVe

been described, and is almost civilised. Steamboats

a narrow passage, in which no one can advance far.
The boatmen say that the Nam Ou fills it at high water,
and then a great many cray-fish (?) are found in it.


The hills become lower, the river expands, and we
arrive at Muong Ngoi, a rather important centre.
The situation is delightful. The houses are built
twrenty yards above the river; they are made of
woven and whitewashed bamboos, which produce the
effect of walls. They contain two stories, and are
built with very sloping roofs; the staircases with
balustrades, balconies, and verandahs, are arranged
outside. They might be taken for Swiss chalets, with
something lighter, more original, and less conventional
about them. But the placard in European letters,
\"Royal Siamese Post-office," throws a discordant note
into the scene.


A Siamese lieutenant, in a yellow silk jacket,
white cotton drawers, bare legs, and slippers, invites
us to tea at his house. He inquires our names, and
promises us some fresh pirogues for the continuation
of our voyage. I take advantage of this visit to
glance at the armoury of the post. It includes
about a dozen rifles of all kinds for percussion caps,
Remingtons, Thai, Laotian, &c.


I take some photographs whilst waiting for the
luggage to be carried from our boat to the other; the
houses in the vdlage are built upon piles; in front of
them, I notice some round cages containing doves,
aud these being half enveloped in stuff to protect
them from the sun, produce from a distance, the
effect of Chinese lanterns.


On the summit of a hillock that overlooks the
valley stands a polygonal embankment formed of red

to us, and as a present. I have no other resource
than to promise to send some remembrance from Van
Bou; evidently the merest trifle will give pleasure.
In fact, commerce is scarcely developed at all here;
the Delta only sends up salt, which is sold for five
piastres the picul (for silver), or seven piastres
represented by the value in merchandise, and matches
(from sevenpence halfpenny to tenpence for ten
boxes; at Hanoi wrorth twopence).


In the evening we enter a superb plain, from one
to two miles wide and twelve miles long, almost
entirely cultivated as rice fields. The river
windingthrough the middle, is dotted with fishing stations
o 1 o
and bordered with bamboo wheels supporting bowls
of six to eight yards in diameter, by which the
water is raised for irrigation. The villages, consisting
of five to fifteen houses, are very numerous, and lie
about every two or three hundred yards on both sides
of the valley. Ban-Co, where we slept, is situated
opposite to Son-La, the site of the old post. The
position, as I have already said, is healthier and
pleasanter than that of Van Bou, but it is less
central, particularly with regard to its
communications. It takes a long day to go from the old post
to the new one, and the return journey is difficult to
accomplish in the same time. For about an hour and
a half after leaving Ban-Co, we reach the edge of the
plain and enter the woods, afterwards descending for
the greater part of the day by a road that is now good
but very fatiguing. On the way I notice some veins
of superb pink marble. We halt at the village of
Muong-Bou, and then regain the road already followed
on our journey to Molou, in the valley of Nam-Pou.

of such, but they are not often consulted, as their
outspoken frankness, their tenacity, their courage and
their common sense, the only qualities, the application
of which will ensure the complete success of our
enterprise in Tonkin, are feared rather than
courted.


A well-ordered internal government of the country
would not suffice for the repression of piracy, for it
would require to be backed up by a vigorous foreign
policy. It is needful that we should be feared by our
neighbours, Siam and China, and that our name
should inspire respect in China, which it does not do
at present upon the other side of our eastern frontier,
which is very barely protected. The pirates are brought
into contact with their former leaders, who are under
the patronage of the Chinese Government, and they
are able to procure arms and money, and to find a
market where they can exchange the Annamite
women for the opium in which they do a contraband
trade to our detriment. They even employ regular
Chinese troops as reinforcements for a fixed price.
This state of things, humiliating for us, cannot even
be excused upon the ground of its being unknown to
those in authority. The organized resistance of the
Viceroy of Canton was denounced as far back as 1887
in the Chamber of Deputies, and since that time it
has been constantly pointed out by the officers
forming part of the boundary commission, while it has
been openly avowed in black and white by officers in
the Chinese service. We have been continually
forewarned, and the warnings have been borne out
by the facts.

sin (colonel), and give him the right of wearing a
transparent light pink decoration for nothing. Since
he has been with us, he seems to have been at variance
with the authorities of the Celestial Empire; but,
however, this did not prevent Muong-La, Manhao,
Mongtze, and other cities of Yunnan paying him
homage on his father's death by sending caravans to
him laden with presents.


It is said that the English themselves have
endeavoured to make terms with him; unless we are
wdling to attribute to chance alone the presence of
an English consular agent, a great traveller in the
Shan countries, who speaks Thai perfectly, on the
boat which carried Deo Van Tri to Haiphong. The
interview was short, and not very profitable, I fancy,
in its results for the representative of Great Britain.


But because Deo Aran Tri assists us, it must not be
supposed that he is entirely devoted to us; he is the
friend of a few Frenchmen rather than of the French
nation; his feeling is a sympathy of persons rather than
of races. It is therefore very desirable that he should
be bound to us by mutual interests, and from this point
of view it was wise to give him the contract for the
transports on the Black River; the rates are fixed, and
the revictualling of the posts is profitable to him.
The tea trade forms a still stronger link between Deo
Van Tri and ourselves. The Chinese tea district of
Ibang is situated about eight days' journey from
Laichau, and its tea gardens are celebrated
throughout China. The leaves, compressed into round cakes,
are sent on the one side to Thibet, and on the other
as far as Pekin; they are even used at the Emperor's
table. Now M. Bourgoing Meiffre has concluded a
<!-- Leaf 415, Page: 399 -->
solved the question of the navigability of the
SongCoi, is that about the middle of 1889 a steamer of the
Messageries Fluviales, the Lao Kay, ascended in sixty
hours from Hanoi to Lao Kay. Since then the attempt
has been often renewed and at varying depths of
water.


The problem then is solved, and the principle
of navigability established. How shall it be turned
to advantage '? Shall vessels be towed or tugged, or
shall sloops of the Oriolle system be used % This
is of little consequence, being a question which
concerns competent engineers, and the main thing is
that a service of steam navigation can be started
upon this river.


But it is not merely from the point of view- of
navigation that the Red River is more important than
the Black River; the valley has certain marked
advantages over that of its confluent. On the Song-Coi
there are no high walls, steep cliffs, or narrow passages,
but only rounded low hills, and on the left bank
above the juncture of the Claire River, no large
tributaries, the water-shed of the two rivers being
very close together. In a word there are few great
obstacles to be overcome whenever the question of
establishing a railway arises.


Note in what terms M. Getten, the engineer,
expresses himself on this subject:


\"As for the construction of a railway in the valley
of the Upper Red River, it is a matter which would
meet with no difficulty; the soil is healthy and firm;
there are no long bridges or tunnels to be made; there
would be no difficulty in laying the foundation of the
various works, and the materials of construction are

annoyed. Shall we, after coming- three days' march to
examine the works at Molou, be obliged to leave
without seeing anything, or to wait three days longer.
while the gods are being propitiated ? At last, with
a little good-wdll on both sides, everything is
amicably arranged. We are to pay the work-people for
anything they do for us, and they will give us the
proceeds of their labour, and thus they will only
benefit indirectly from it; in this way they will not
appear to break their compulsory rest.


About one hundred yards from the village four
wells have been dug; they are nearly twenty yards
deep and one square yard wude. Above each of them
a small shelter carries a bamboo windlass, moved by
a capstan, on which a leather strap is rolled. Two
coolies work at each well; one descends to the
bottom by opening his legs and hands and catching
them in the notches made in the walls, the other
remains at the opening. The galleries communicate.
and the workmen use wooden lamps, lighted with oil
of sesamum and a cotton mesh. The wTork is only
carried on during the four wdnter months, for in
summer the heat is too great. Each man fills about ten
baskets a clay (each basket holding from twenty to
fortv pounds). The land is clayey, of two colours,
yellow or brown, according to the hole. And the most
gold seems drawn from the second. I remark, by the
side of round stones, some fragments of quartz, with
quite fresh edges. The labourers tell us that the
auriferous earth follows a certain line and winds like
the bed of a river, so we wonder -whether the bed has
not been formed by the decomposition of the schists

their large leaves of bright green, form a pleasing
contrast to the autumnal tints of the bamboos.


The villages often consist of no more than two or
three houses, built about 130 feet above the level ofthe
river, which is here only from 250 to 400 feet wide, the
rocks along its banks, which were chiefly of schist where
we were yesterday, being now mainly chalk, in which
I discovered several fossils. The water is clear, and in
many places the bed is lined with the green weeds which
our men are so pleased to gather and cook. Despite
the rapids we get along at a good pace, our halting
place to-day being Takoa, and we have done the
distance from Van-Yen in two and a half days instead
of four.


Upon the 9th we do not make a start till
late, being obliged to lay in a fresh supply of
provisions. Situated upon the right bank of the
river, Takoa is a large village and a small
commercial centre, including nine Chinese houses. These
are built upon a level with the soil, and their owners
trade in salt, opium, and tobacco, which they
exchange for native products. Transactions in this region
are facilitated by the unfettered traffic in opium, for
beyond the limits of Cho-Bo there is no monopoly,
and to create one would be tantamount to setting up
piracy. At the present time the attacks on the canoes
below Van-Yen have somewhat hampered trade.
Such, at least, is the information given us by a gaunt
and decrepit old Chinaman, whose livid complexion
betrays his liking for opium, as he shows us the
cannon and the revolvers of the Leygue, a steam sloop
which the Pavie Mission succeeded in getting up this
far, and which eventually grounded after having made
